SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the \"Registration Statement\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore. Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.

Section 1.5 Integrity acknowledges that, whenever in the judgment of the Fund's officers such action is warranted for any reason, including, without limitation, market, economic, or political conditions, those officers may decline to accept any orders for, or make any sales of, the Shares until such time as those officers deem it advisable to accept such orders and to make such sales. Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund's then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan. Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement. Section 1.9 Integrity shall prepare and deliver reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser on a regular, at least quarterly, basis, showing the distribution expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan and the purposes therefore, as well as any supplemental reports as the Trustees, from time to time, may reasonably request. SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE FUND Section 2.1 The Fund agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents, to furnish any and all information, and to take any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that Integrity may designate. Section 2.2 The Fund shall furnish from time to time, for use in connection with the sale of the Shares, such information reports with respect to the Fund and its Shares as Integrity may reasonably request, all of which shall be signed by one or more of the Fund's duly authorized officers; and the Fund warrants that the statements contained in any such reports, when so signed by one or more of the Fund's officers, shall be true and correct. The Fund shall also furnish Integrity upon request with: (a) annual audits of the Fund's books and accounts made by independent public accountants regularly retained by the Fund, (b) semi-annual unaudited financial statements pertaining to the Fund, (c) quarterly earnings statements prepared by the Fund, (d) a monthly itemized list of the securities in the portfolio of the Fund, (e) monthly balance sheets as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and (f) from time to time such additional information regarding the Fund's financial condition as Integrity may reasonably request. Section 2.3 The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the terms \"registration statement,\" \"prospectus,\" and \"statement of additional information\" shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity's counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund's right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 4. INDEMNIFICATION Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares. The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to Integrity's benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Integrity agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Fund, its several officers and trustees, and any person who controls the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such information not misleading. Integrity's agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity's being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 5\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action. SECTION 5. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION Section 5.1 None of the Shares shall be offered by either Integrity or the Fund under any of the provisions of this Agreement and no orders for the purchase or sale of the Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Fund if and so long as the effectiveness of the registration statement then in effect or any necessary amendments thereto shall be suspended under any of the provisions of the 1933 Act or if and so long as a current prospectus as required by Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act is not on file with the SEC; provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph 5 shall in any way restrict or have an application to or bearing upon the Fund's obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's prospectus, statement of additional information, or declaration of trust.

Section 8.2 It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Fund hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers, agents, or employees of the Fund, personally, but bind only the property of the Fund. The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees and signed by an authorized officer of the Fund, acting as such, and neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the property of the Fund. 7\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8.3 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas. Section 8.4 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original; but such counterparts shall, together, constitute only one instrument.

(a)  ENERGOUS warrants that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die will conform to the Product Specifications and will be free from defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials do not infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it did not misappropriate any third party's trade secrets in the development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including any software updates if any), no Product will contain any viruses, \"Trojan horses\" or other harmful code. The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.   (b) The warranty contained in Section 11.2(a) does not apply to the extent any Product is operated in a manner other than that specified by the Product Specifications, is treated with abuse, negligence or other improper treatment (including, without limitation, use outside the device maximum ratings, package MSL (moisture sensitivity level) guidelines or environmental limits as may be set forth in the Product Specifications), or is defective as a result of any materials or workmanship of the Manufacturing Subcontractors or failure of the Manufacturing Subcontractors to manufacture the Product according to Approved Production Specifications. As such, any warranty claims due to defects in build, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its Affiliate and such parties.   (c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation of third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die developed by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.   (d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and expenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs, replacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS' aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately notify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in any event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will expeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure's root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS' investigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.3  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or any of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:   (a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS' best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable to so procure such right,   (b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing, provided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to the infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.   If none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit DIALOG's rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.   11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING, DOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.   12. INDEMNIFICATION.   12.1 Indemnification by Energous. Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third party claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and customers (collectively, \"DIALOG Indemnitees\") from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused by or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in relation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Products or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors' manufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and Approved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the Approved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party Marks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (g) ENERGOUS' negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.\n\n  Page 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.2 Exclusion. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, ENERGOUS will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a) modification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the Products with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor (except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such Manufacturing Subcontractor's manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications, Approved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee. For clarification, if any of the foregoing is not the cause, in whole or in part of the Claim, ENERGOUS is not relieved of its obligations under Section 12.1.   12.3 Conditions. DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, any failure or delay in notice will not relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that ENERGOUS is actually prejudiced by such failure to notify. ENERGOUS will have control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise or settlement of such third party Claim (except to the extent that any settlement involves any commitments, responsibilities or obligations on the part of DIALOG, in which case such settlement will require the prior written consent of DIALOG, which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may reasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS' expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own cost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or does not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs incurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service Fees payable.\n\n  Page 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.4 Insurance. Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.   13.

IN ADDITION, ENERGOUS' LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 12.1(b) SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED [***]. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE INDEPENDENT FROM ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.   14. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.   Each party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such party's performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government.

ESCROW.   16.1 Escrow. ENERGOUS will at its expense, at DIALOG's written request during the Term and any Wind Down Period, enter into a three- party escrow deposit arrangement, in accordance with this Section 16, with a recognized escrow agent (the \"Escrow Agent\") of mutual agreement. ENERGOUS will keep the Deposit Materials in escrow and ensure on a quarterly basis that all the information relating to the Deposit Materials in escrow is current, including deposit of any Product Updates.   16.2 Release of Deposit Materials. In the event of any Insolvency Event and where the design files need to be accessed by DIALOG to fix an Epidemic Defect or other Product design or production issue impacting yield or quality (\"Release Condition\"), the Escrow Agent will, in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement between the parties and the Escrow Agent (the \"Escrow Agreement\"), release the Deposit Materials to DIALOG.   16.3 License. ENERGOUS hereby grants DIALOG a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as set forth in Section 2) license under the Product IP to use any of the Deposit Materials released from escrow for the purpose of fixing an Epidemic Defect or other Product design or production issue impacting yield or quality during the Term and, if applicable, any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, including, but not limited to, authorizing any third party subcontractor to manufacture and supply Products, provided, however, that DIALOG continues to make all Royalty payment owed to ENERGOUS (or the then-current owner of the Product IP) as provided in this Agreement. No Service Fees will be payable under this license. DIALOG agrees not to exercise such license until occurrence of a Release Condition, subject to the other restrictions set forth in this Section 16. Such license may be exercised by DIALOG only during the Term and any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period and is subject to DIALOG's continued compliance with all of the other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement during any such applicable period. All Deposit Materials will be deemed ENERGOUS' Confidential Information hereunder. DIALOG's license to possess and use the Deposit Materials does not include any right to disclose, market, sublicense or distribute the Deposit Materials to any third party other than its Affiliates and Manufacturing Subcontractors.   16.4 Rights in Bankruptcy. The licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement are license to rights in \"intellectual property\" (as that term is defined in Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code) and governed by 11 USC Section 365(n). Accordingly, if a trustee in bankruptcy rejects the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement as executory contracts, then Company may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement in accordance with and subject to the provisions of 11 USC Section 365(n).\n\n  Page 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17. PUBLICITY.   17.1 Publicity. Within 30 days of the Effective Date each party will issue a mutually agreed joint press release regarding the strategic cooperation for the supply of Products and the strategic cooperation between the parties.   18.

ENERGOUS and DIALOG acknowledge and agree that the covenants in this Section 18 are reasonable and necessary to protect each of their trade secrets, Confidential Information and stable workforces.   19. CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   19.1 Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.   19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  20.

Accordingly, it is agreed that either Party shall be entitled, without proof of special damages, to seek an injunction or other  interim remedy for any threatened or actual breach of this Clause, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which that Party may have.     12.

Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below). RECITALS WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into that certain Services Agreement dated as of January 1, 2004 (as amended, the \"Services Agreement\"), pursuant to which FASC provides certain performance attribution and administration and risk management services to Adviser in connection with Adviser providing investment advisory or sub-advisory services to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"1940 Act\") and/or separate accounts not required to be so registered (collectively, \"Accounts\"); WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into the Amendment to Services Agreement dated as of March 30, 2009 (the \"Amendment\"), pursuant to which the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement were amended solely with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, to provide that, as part of the administration and risk management services provided by FASC, FASC may provide certain coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts; and WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC desire to amend the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement, as amended, solely with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, to provide that FASC may provide equity trading and transaction settlement, fundamental analysis and quantitative analysis services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Second Amendment to Exhibit A to Services Agreement. Exhibit A to the Services Agreement shall be, and here by is, supplemented with the following: \"3. Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement. The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. 4. Fundamental Analysis. The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser. 5. Quantitative Analysis. Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers. To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.\" 2.

Such persons shall endeavor to assure clear and responsive communication between the Parties and the effective exchange of information, and may serve as the primary point of contact for any matters arising under this Agreement. The Alliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties' good faith discussions, and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(b) Joint Steering Committee. The Parties hereby establish a joint steering committee (the \"JSC\") that will monitor and provide strategic oversight of the activities under this Agreement, and facilitate communications between the Parties with respect to the supply of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum's development and commercialization of Bellicum Products. Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3) representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non- voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising within the scope of the JSC's responsibilities. The Parties' initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replace its JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace a representative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The JSC shall meet at least two times each Calendar Year, and at least one such JSC meeting shall be in person/ face-to-face with alternating locations (for in person/ face-to-face meetings only), unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. Each Party may invite up to three (3) of its own employees, and the JSC may invite other non-members, to participate in the discussions and meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC. The JSC shall have two (2) co- chairpersons, one from each Party. The role of the co-chairpersons shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC. The Alliance Managers shall work with the co-chairpersons to prepare and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes. The co- chairpersons shall have no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC representatives.\n\n(c) Specific Responsibilities of the JSC. In addition to its overall responsibility for monitoring and providing strategic oversight with respect to the Parties' activities under this Agreement, the JSC shall in particular: (i) oversee the collaborative efforts of the Parties under this Agreement; (ii) review and discuss the research, development and commercialization of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum Products, including regulatory matters related thereto; (iii) attempt to resolve Disputes presented by the Alliance Managers; and (iv) perform such other functions as appropriate to further the purposes of this Agreement, in each case, as agreed in writing by the Parties. The JSC has no authority to modify this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or any Module.\n\nARTICLE 3 PRODUCT QUALITY; CHANGE CONTROL\n\n3.1 Product Quality.\n\n(a) Product Specifications. Miltenyi shall manufacture or have manufactured the Miltenyi Products to meet the agreed Product Specifications, as then in effect, as published by Miltenyi from time to time, or as set forth in the Quality Agreement, as applicable.\n\n(b) Agreed Standards. All Miltenyi Products shall be manufactured and quality controlled in compliance with and pursuant to: (i) the Agreed Standards, (ii) the requirements of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, and (iii) Applicable Laws.\n\n(c) Testing. Miltenyi shall have standard analytical testing performed on each batch of Miltenyi Product to be shipped to Bellicum, in accordance with Agreed Standards and the procedures described in the corresponding documentation, to verify that Miltenyi Product meets Product Specifications and that it was manufactured in accordance with Agreed Standards and Applicable Laws.\n\n(d) Quality System. All Miltenyi Products supplied under this Agreement shall be manufactured and quality controlled under an appropriate quality system in accordance with Agreed Standards, as more fully described in the Quality Agreement (as applicable). Any subsequent change to Miltenyi's quality system that, as Bellicum can reasonably establish, would have or is likely to have a material effect on the safety, efficacy, identity and/or quality of a Miltenyi Product or its Permitted Use, requires the Parties to discuss and agree upon each such change in writing.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(e) Quality Agreement. Within [...***...] days from the Effective Date (or such longer period as agreed by the Parties in writing, but in any event prior to the first delivery of Clinical Grade Product to Bellicum), the Parties shall enter into an agreement on mutually acceptable, commercially reasonable terms that details the quality assurance obligations of each Party relating to Clinical Grade Products (the \"Quality Agreement\"). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the Quality Agreement shall govern in respect of quality issues.\n\n3.2 Change Control.\n\n(a) General. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Section 3.2 and in the Quality Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing from time to time, Miltenyi reserves the right to periodically make changes to the Product Specifications, Agreed Standards and/or otherwise with respect to the properties, manufacture and/or testing of the Miltenyi Products (including changes with respect to: suppliers of raw materials; quality in raw materials; methods of manufacturing; packaging; equipment and/or premises; Subcontractors; product control techniques and methods of analysis; product release specifications; and/or presentation and content of relevant documentation, including certificates pursuant to Section 6.5) from time to time during the Term (each, a \"Change\").\n\n(b) Change Notification. Change notifications shall be provided in accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in the Quality Agreement or in this Agreement. In the event that Miltenyi proposes a Material Change, unless such proposed Change is a Required Change pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below and there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation of such Required Change, Miltenyi shall give Bellicum at least [...***...] months' advance written notice prior to implementation of the proposed Material Change (a \"Change Notification\"). Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum all information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding any Change under this subsection, if applicable.\n\n(c) Changes Required for Compliance. If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonable judgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally (in each case, a \"Required Change\"), Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a Required Change is specifically related to the use of Miltenyi Product for a Permitted Use in relation to a Bellicum Product (a \"Bellicum-Specific Required Change\"), then Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Bellicum-Specific Required Change only if and to the extent Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of any such Bellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change, if any. Miltenyi and Bellicum shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement on (i) the new Product Price, if any, for any Miltenyi Product which embodies such Required Change, giving due consideration to the effect of such change on Miltenyi's manufacturing costs for the changed Miltenyi Product as well as any other relevant factors, (ii) the responsibility for any costs and expenses associated with Miltenyi's activities required to implement such Change, and (iii) any other amendments to this Agreement which may be necessitated by such Change (e.g., an adjustment to the lead time for firm orders). For clarity, Miltenyi shall have no obligation to implement a Bellicum-Specific Required Change unless and until the Parties have reached agreement on all items as described in the preceding sentence.\n\n(d) Changes Requested by Bellicum. If during the Term Bellicum desires Miltenyi to make any Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nAuthorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a \"Bellicum-Requested Change\"), Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi thereof in writing. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi's consent. Miltenyi may withhold its consent to an Bellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) does not comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could have potential adverse impact on Miltenyi's manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. In addition, a Bellicum-Requested Change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted as promptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by Miltenyi, at Bellicum's cost, and shall be subject to Miltenyi and Bellicum reaching agreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product Price necessitated by any such Bellicum-Requested Change. If Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of the proposed Bellicum- Requested Change and accepts a proposed Product Price adjustment that reflects a change in Miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting from such Bellicum-Requested Change, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change. For clarity, an agreed adjustment to the Product Price shall become effective only with respect to orders for Miltenyi Products that are manufactured in accordance with the Bellicum-Requested Change.\n\n(e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a \"Miltenyi-Requested Change\"), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advance written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the \"Changed Miltenyi Product\" (meaning such Miltenyi Product that is produced under conditions of the Miltenyi-Requested Change) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as such Changed Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatory approvals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own cost and expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum's perspective, then any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Changed Miltenyi Products.\n\n(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Parties shall cooperate, share information, and otherwise act in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals or manufacturing permits for Miltenyi Product and Bellicum Product, respectively.\n\n(g) Continued Supply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of a proposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested by Bellicum, discussed with Bellicum in good faith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Change for as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [...***...], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any required amendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi's Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nPrice necessitated by any such continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product during such period. Until such agreement is reached, any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products described in this subsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Products produced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g) is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified in a Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (g), in the event that Bellicum reasonably determines to reject a proposed Material Change (including a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi will continue to supply the applicable Miltenyi Product without such change after expiry of the said 6-month period and during the Term of this Agreement, or until Bellicum has secured an alternate source of supply from a Third Party manufacturer; provided, however, that the Parties will discuss in good faith, reflecting the change in circumstances contemplated by this Section 3.2(h), and agree in writing upon commercially reasonable terms to be set forth in an amendment to this Agreement to reflect any demonstrable increased cost and effort (if any) resulting from the manufacture of unchanged Miltenyi Product solely for Bellicum, including (as an example) any applicable adjustments to Forecasts, Lead Times, production cycles, batch sizes, Delivery Dates, Product Prices, or other relevant issues. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding such amendment, any obligations of Bellicum in relation to a Forecast for the affected Miltentyi Product in months 7-12 of the applicable Monthly Forecast, and any limitations regarding forecast variances, as each of these are set forth in Article 5, will not apply to a Miltenyi Product produced after implementation of such Material Change (i.e., one that replaces such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product), and Miltenyi shall be relieved from any obligations to supply such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product under this Agreement after the period described in the first sentence of this subsection (h) ends. For clarity, in no event shall Miltenyi be required to manufacture, supply or sell an existing Miltenyi Product to which a Required Change must be applied.\n\n(i) Research Grade Products. The notification requirements of the second sentence of Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement with respect to Material Changes and the obligations of Section 3.2(g) with respect to Continued Supply shall not apply to Research Grade Products.\n\n(j) Costs. Bellicum shall have responsibility for any Regulatory Authority filing fees and other costs and expenses incurred by Bellicum in connection with any filing or required amendment or other modification of regulatory approvals or consents for Bellicum Product resulting from any Change pursuant this Section 3.2, if applicable.\n\nARTICLE 4 REGULATORY\n\n4.1 Regulatory Responsibility.\n\n(a) Bellicum Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Miltenyi Products that are solely reserved by Miltenyi under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Bellicum will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Bellicum Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(b) Miltenyi Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Bellicum Product(s) that are solely reserved by Bellicum under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Miltenyi will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Miltenyi Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(c) Disclaimer. Bellicum hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set out with respect to any Miltenyi Product in the Product Specifications or in the Quality Agreement, as\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\napplicable, the Miltenyi Products have no approvals by Regulatory Authorities in the Territory for use in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or other clinical applications, or for any other use requiring compliance with any law or regulation regulating clinical, diagnostic or therapeutic products or any similar product (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Regulatory Laws\"). Bellicum further acknowledges and agrees that Miltenyi Products have not yet been fully tested or validated for safety or effectiveness in connection with Bellicum's Permitted Use. Save as set out in the Product Specifications or the applicable Quality Agreement, it shall be the sole responsibility of Bellicum to test and validate the Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's contemplated Permitted Use hereunder and to take all other actions necessary to establish compliance of Bellicum's Permitted Use thereof with all regulatory requirements, and to ensure that any Bellicum Product resulting from such Permitted Use meets all applicable safety, quality, or other regulatory requirements (including Regulatory Laws), in each case prior to the first use of such Miltenyi Product.\n\n(d) The Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder may not be used for any purpose that would require Regulatory Authority approvals or consents unless such proper Regulatory Authority approvals or consents have been obtained. Bellicum agrees that if it elects to use, or causes any Bellicum Subcontractor or Licensee to use, any Miltenyi Products for a purpose that would subject Miltenyi or such Miltenyi Products to the jurisdiction of any Regulatory Laws, Bellicum will be solely responsible for obtaining any required Regulatory Authority approvals or consents, and for otherwise ensuring that Bellicum's (or its Subcontractors' or Licensees') use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose complies with such Regulatory Laws. Bellicum shall defend and indemnify Miltenyi and its Affiliates against any liability, damage, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of Bellicum's failure to obtain all necessary Regulatory Authority approvals or consents or to comply with any Regulatory Laws in relation to Bellicum's use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose.\n\n4.2 Regulatory Authority Requirements. Miltenyi states that (i) Miltenyi is obliged by relevant Regulatory Authorities to keep a record of all of its customer's clinical trials that use Miltenyi Products (name and title of clinical trials, the official registration numbers, name and addresses of the involved principal investigators and clinical trial centers as well as the corresponding formal document granting approval of an IND (for example only, IND/CTA acknowledgement letter of the relevant Regulatory Authority(ies) involving the use of \"IDE/CRR\"- labelled Miltenyi Products)) (regardless of whether such clinical trials are sponsored by Miltenyi or by any Third Party); and (ii) Miltenyi is not permitted to provide \"IDE/CRR\"-labeled Miltenyi Products to customers in the United States for use in clinical trials if the IND or IDE is not approved by the respective regulatory authority or rejected. . Miltenyi shall act and shall have no liability to Bellicum for acting in accordance with the foregoing requirements. As used herein, \"CTA\" means a clinical trial application; \"IDE\" means an investigational device exemption; and \"IDE/CRR\" references a certain subset of Miltenyi Products labeled with the \"IDE/CRR\" designation.\n\n4.3 Regulatory Work. Miltenyi has established, or may from time to time establish, Master Files for one or more Miltenyi Products with one or more Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Miltenyi shall maintain each such Master File in accordance with Applicable Laws (\"Regulatory Work\"). To the extent Bellicum requests that Miltenyi generate any additional Master File and/or add additional information to any existing Master File, the provisions of Section 4.4 \"Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services\" below shall apply.\n\n4.4 Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services. With respect to any Bellicum Product, Bellicum may request that Miltenyi provide additional regulatory assistance beyond the scope of the Regulatory Work, and/or may request that Miltenyi perform additional services (i.e. generation of additional supportive data for inclusion in a Master File) that alter, amend, or add to the Regulatory Work. Bellicum shall submit each such request to Miltenyi with reasonable detail in writing. Any request that constitutes a material modification or increase in scope of the Regulatory Work or an agreement for the provision of additional services shall require a written amendment to this Agreement via the Bellicum Product- or Bellicum Program-specific Module signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Such amendment\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall specify in detail any modification or scope change of the Regulatory Work performed by Miltenyi, the appropriate compensation (if any) or basis for such compensation to be paid to Miltenyi by Bellicum for the performance of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services, and the appropriate time schedule for completion of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services. Upon executing such written amendment, the additional Regulatory Work assistance or services shall be deemed included within Regulatory Work and subject to the standards of performance described in this Agreement.\n\n4.5 Master Files; Right to Cross Reference. Upon Bellicum's written request, subject to Section 4.9, Miltenyi shall submit a cross reference letter to the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) in any Designated Country in which Miltenyi maintains a Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s), authorizing such Regulatory Authority(ies) to access and refer to such Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) to the extent such information is reasonably required for regulatory purposes to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals for the Permitted Use of the Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the Bellicum Product(s); provided, however, that Bellicum shall first provide to Miltenyi all necessary information about such Bellicum Product that is reasonably included in such cross reference letter.\n\n4.6 Rights to Master Files. Miltenyi shall solely own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Master File(s) (and any pertaining regulatory documentation). Bellicum shall have no right to access the Master File(s), or, except as expressly set forth in Section 4.5 supra, to require the disclosure by Miltenyi of any information contained in any Master File, or to cross-reference or otherwise use the Master File(s) for any purpose other than as expressly provided herein.\n\n4.7 Communication to/from Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(a) Communication from Regulatory Authorities. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any material communication from any Regulatory Authority that is related specifically to (i) the safety and/or functionality of any Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the use thereof for the manufacture of Bellicum Product or (ii) the safety and/or functionality of any Bellicum Product(s) as the same relate or could relate to a Miltenyi Product and/or the use of Miltenyi Product(s) in the manufacture of Bellicum Product(s), and that would, in each case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either Party's products that are the subject matter of this Agreement, or ability of a Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (collectively, \"Communication(s)\"). Each Party shall, as soon as practicable after any contact with or receipt of any Communication, forward a copy or description of the same (to the extent it so relates) to the other Party. Each Party reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such Communications. Each Party shall obligate its Affiliates and Subcontractors accordingly.\n\n(b) Communication to Regulatory Authorities. In the event that a response to a Regulatory Authority is required in connection with any Communication, Bellicum will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority in connection with any regulatory submission regarding a Bellicum Product, or any non-Miltenyi Product component thereof (Miltenyi will provide its proposed response regarding any Miltenyi Product component thereof), and any non-product-specific information and/or non-procedure-specific information related to Bellicum, and Miltenyi will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority regarding a Miltenyi Product regulatory submission or any component thereof, the Master Files, and any non-product specific information related to Miltenyi. If Miltenyi's response is requested and needed in connection with any Bellicum Product regulatory submission, and a delayed response is likely to delay development or commercialization of such Bellicum Product, then Miltenyi will promptly use its diligent efforts to provide such response as soon as practicable. At the responding Party's reasonable request and expense, the other Party will collaborate in good faith with the responding Party in preparing such responses and, subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, will provide the responding\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nParty with information that the responding Party reasonably believes is required to develop a requested response for questions in relation to such Communication.\n\n(c) Required Communications. If Bellicum is required to communicate with any Regulatory Authority specifically regarding any Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall so advise Miltenyi as soon as practicable and, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, or to the extent that such a disclosure would result in the violation of any contractual obligations to a Third Party, provide Miltenyi in advance with a copy of any proposed written Communication with such Regulatory Authority to the extent that such Communication pertains to Miltenyi Products; provided that Bellicum reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such copy. Bellicum shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all reasonable direction of Miltenyi pertaining to the foregoing. To the extent permitted by the Regulatory Authority, Miltenyi shall have the right to participate in any planned oral Communications or meetings between Bellicum and any Regulatory Authority specifically relating to Miltenyi Products or Miltenyi Technology. For purposes of clarification, the obligations imposed on Bellicum pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall not apply with respect to Communications with Regulatory Authorities that are focused primarily on a non-Miltenyi Product portions or on a Bellicum Product.\n\n4.8 Assistance. Miltenyi shall, if requested by Bellicum, consult with and provide reasonable assistance to Bellicum with regard to regulatory matters concerning the Miltenyi Products, as appropriate, provided that for any assistance regarding regulatory matters that is beyond the scope of standard use of the Miltenyi Products as made available in Miltenyi's catalogue, Bellicum shall pay for Miltenyi's time for such consulting and assistance at Miltenyi's then-standard rates, which scope and limits shall be discussed between the Parties and mutually agreed in writing prior to the performance of the assistance by Miltenyi (subject to the Parties' representations, warranties and liabilities under this Agreement). Absent Miltenyi's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Bellicum shall bear all responsibility for Bellicum's or Bellicum Subcontractors' use of information provided by Miltenyi (including use in regulatory filings and any Third Party liability) pursuant to this Section 4.8.\n\n4.9 Additional Filings. Bellicum acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Master Files in relation to Miltenyi's supply obligations have not been filed in all jurisdictions worldwide. If Bellicum desires to pursue clinical evaluations related to the approvability or approval of any Bellicum Product or decides to pursue commercialization of any Bellicum Product in any jurisdiction where Miltenyi does not then have an active Master File, and Bellicum would not legally be able to conduct such evaluation or commercialization without Miltenyi filing a Master File in such jurisdiction or making necessary information available to the Regulatory Authority, then Bellicum shall so notify Miltenyi, and the Parties shall discuss in good faith the terms and conditions under which Miltenyi would be willing to file such Master File or provide necessary information to the Regulatory Authority including additional compensation to Miltenyi (if any), but Miltenyi shall not be obligated to file such Master File or provide such information, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing on such commercially reasonable terms and conditions. To the extent requested by Bellicum in writing from time to time to amend the Bellicum Product specific Module to include Additional Countries, Miltenyi shall work in good faith with Bellicum to include such Additional Countries in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 supra.\n\n4.10 Disclaimer. Except as provided in this Article 4 or otherwise in the Agreement, Miltenyi provides no warranty that any Master File or other regulatory dossier or submission by Miltenyi or Bellicum will be approved by any Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall in no way be held responsible for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority or ethics committee to grant permission to conduct a clinical trial(s) and/or for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority to grant approval under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or under a Biological License Application (BLA) or for compassionate use for a Bellicum Product.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 5 FORECASTS AND ORDERS\n\n5.1 Forecasts. In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework for forecasting Bellicum's orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agrees to provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum's (and its Subcontractors' and Licensees') anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1 (each, a \"Forecast\"). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitly agreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplement this Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided under this Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) and manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreed Miltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [...***...] in preparing all Forecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorized representative of Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile, and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.\n\n(a) Rolling Monthly Forecast; Firm Zone. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a monthly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products within the Forecast Territory (on a manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis) for each of the next twelve (12) consecutive Calendar Months (e.g., year 1: months 1-12), commencing with the Calendar Month in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a \"Monthly Forecast\"). (For clarity, the initial Monthly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 1, i.e., Calendar Months 1-12; the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous Monthly Forecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1st) three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for Miltenyi Products submitted during the Term, [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1st) three (3) month period of each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the \"Firm Zone\") shall be binding, and the corresponding portion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity, all forecasted quantities of Miltenyi Products during the Firm Zone shall constitute a binding commitment by Bellicum to submit corresponding Purchase Orders for Miltenyi Products. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, a Monthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n(b) Rolling Quarterly Forecast. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each last month of a Calendar Quarter during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a non-binding quarterly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the four (4) Calendar Quarters immediately following the last month of such Calendar Quarter (each, a \"Quarterly Forecast\"). Each Quarterly Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on a quarterly basis. (For clarity, the initial Quarterly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 2, i.e. Calendar Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 (covering Calendar Months 13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 22-24); the following Quarterly Forecast will cover the four Calendar Quarter period following the Calendar Quarter 1 of the previous Quarterly Forecast, i.e. Calendar Quarters 2-5.) A Quarterly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(c) Long-Term Forecast. In addition, Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) shall within [...***...] days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by [...***...] of each Calendar Year during the Term, submit a non-binding annual rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the next three (3) consecutive Calendar Years, commencing with the Calendar Year in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a \"Long-Term Forecast\") for the purposes of assisting Miltenyi with its capacity and production planning for Miltenyi Products during such period. Each Long-Term Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on an annual basis. (For clarity, the initial Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years 3 to 5; the following Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years period following the previous Calendar Year 3 of the previous Long-Term Forecast, i.e. Calendar Years 4-5.) A Long Term Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties and shall serve to assess future capacity planning at Miltenyi.\n\n(d) Forecasts Due Periodically. In the event that Miltenyi has failed to receive an updated Forecast for any relevant forecast period within the times or by the dates provided in clauses (a) through (c) above, Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of such failure in writing and, if Bellicum fails to respond with an updated Forecast by the [...***...] day of a Calendar Month of the relevant forecast period, the most recent Forecast shall be regarded as current.\n\n(e) Acceptable Forecast Variance. Outside the Firm Zone, Bellicum may increase or decrease the amount of Miltenyi Product forecast for each Calendar Month of each Monthly Forecast by up to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 4 through 6, and by [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 7 through 12, compared to the amount of Miltenyi Product that was forecast for the comparable Calendar Month in the prior Monthly Forecast provided in accordance with this Agreement, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, (e.g., the forecast for the fourth Calendar Month in a Monthly Forecast may not increase or decrease by more than [...***...]% of the amount of any particular Miltenyi Product in any particular country forecast for the fifth Calendar Month of the prior Monthly Forecast). For clarity, variances with respect to forecasts submitted for any Calendar Month within the Firm Zone shall not be acceptable.\n\n5.2 Volume Limitations.\n\n(a) Subject to Bellicum's adherence to its Forecast obligations pursuant to Section 5.1 above, or as specifically modified in a specific Module, Miltenyi shall meet the demands of any Purchase Orders (as defined below) that are made by Bellicum in compliance with the Forecasts. Miltenyi shall not be obligated to supply Bellicum with quantities of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the most recent Forecast provided to Miltenyi but agrees to use [...***...] to satisfy Bellicum's requirement of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the relevant Forecast quantities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it is or will be unable to supply any desired quantity of Miltenyi Product pursuant to a Purchase Order that falls within the relevant Forecast on or before the applicable Delivery date(s) therefor, Miltenyi shall promptly inform Bellicum, and then, the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery, Bellicum may, to be determined in Bellicum's reasonable discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, at its option, cancel the Purchase Order.\n\n5.3 Firm Zone Requirements. Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for each Calendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreement shall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and in each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s) specified for the first (1st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(such amount, the \"Firm Zone Requirements\"). The Firm Zone Requirement shall not apply within the first three months of the Effective Date of the Agreement. Within [...***...] days of the end of each Calendar Quarter, Miltenyi will calculate the total Firm Zone Requirements for each of the three (3) Calendar Months during that Calendar Quarter. In the event that Bellicum fails to order the Firm Zone Requirements of Miltenyi Product from Miltenyi during any particular Calendar Month in the relevant Calendar Quarter in which Miltenyi was ready, willing and able to Deliver Miltenyi Product in accordance with the applicable Monthly Forecast, then the \"Firm Zone Order Shortfall\" shall be the total amount by which the Firm Zone Requirements for any given Calendar Month during such Calendar Quarter exceed the amount of Miltenyi Product actually ordered by Bellicum during such Calendar Month. Miltenyi will invoice Bellicum for an amount equal to the Firm Zone Shortfall and Bellicum will pay such invoice within [...***...] days of the invoice date. Upon Bellicum's request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum, provide Bellicum with Miltenyi's remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfall amount.\n\n5.4 Purchase Orders. This Section 5.4 sets forth a general framework for Purchase Order-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module.\n\n(a) Bellicum shall order Miltenyi Products by submitting written purchase orders to Miltenyi, in such form as the Parties may agree from time to time and in accordance with any applicable Lead Times and the provisions of this Article 5 (each, a \"Purchase Order\"). All Purchase Orders (and any related acceptances or objections by Miltenyi) may be delivered electronically or by other means to Miltenyi's applicable sales representative located in the country of the shipping destination or to such location as Miltenyi shall reasonably designate from time to time.\n\n(b) Each Purchase Order will specify the MB Global Contract Number assigned to this Agreement, the volumes of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered, the desired Delivery date(s) the Miltenyi Products are to be made available to Bellicum for pick-up by Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, the relevant ship-to address, and any special shipping instructions. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in a defined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.\n\n(c) Bellicum shall submit each Purchase Order to Miltenyi reasonably prior to the desired Delivery date(s), which shall be no sooner than the applicable Lead Time(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s); provided that absent an applicable Lead Time, the Purchase Order shall be submitted at least [...***...] days in advance of the desired Delivery date specified in such Purchase Order; and provided further that Miltenyi shall use diligent and good faith efforts to Deliver before the desiredDelivery date.\n\n(d) Purchase Orders shall be firm and binding upon written acceptance by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order by written notice (sent by fax, mail, overnight courier or e-mail) to Bellicum within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum. If Miltenyi fails to confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum, then Bellicum will contact Miltenyi to verify Miltenyi's receipt and acceptance of such Purchase Order and request written confirmation thereof from Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall accept all Purchase Orders for quantities of Miltenyi Product that are within the Firm Zone Requirement amounts specified for the relevant Calendar Month in the applicable Monthly Forecast.\n\n(e) Each Purchase Order shall reference the MB Global Contract Reference Number (MBGCR) defined in the respective Modules, submitted by Bellicum to Miltenyi shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Module and the applicable Quality Agreement. None of the terms and conditions set forth on any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document shall change or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Module shall\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsupersede any conflicting term or condition set forth in any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document furnished by Bellicum to Miltenyi or by Miltenyi to Bellicum, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchase Orders may only contain products to be ordered under a single MBGCR. The combination of products referring to different MBGCR in one Purchase Order, or a combination of products referencing a MBGCR and products not referencing a MBGCR in one Purchase Order is not possible.\n\n(f) In the event of a Bellicum Product safety issue, withdrawal or hold on use of a Bellicum Product by a Regulatory Authority or other issue that directly results in a material reduction or elimination of Bellicum's quantity requirements for a particular Miltenyi Product(s), the Parties will discuss promptly and in good faith adjustments to the permitted forecast variance described in Section 5.1(e) during the period when such circumstance exists, and other steps that could be taken to soften the impact of such circumstance on each Party.\n\n5.5 Changes to Purchase Orders. Subject to Section 5.2 and applicable Lead Times, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to comply with unplanned changes in Purchase Orders requested by Bellicum either in terms of quantities or Delivery dates. All requests for changes to Purchase Orders shall be submitted in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all supplementary costs that result from the implementation of any unplanned change to an accepted Purchase Order requested by Bellicum.\n\n5.6 Minimum Purchases. This Section 5.6 sets forth a general framework for Minimum Purchases-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module. In the event Bellicum's aggregate purchases of Miltenyi Products from Miltenyi under this Agreement in any Calendar Year during the Term is less than [...***...]% of the Rolling Monthly Forecast subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, at the beginning of that Calendar Year or \u20ac[...***...] ([...***...] Euros), whatever is higher, (the \"Minimum Purchase\"), then Miltenyi shall provide written notice to Bellicum of such shortfall. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the \u20ac[...***...] amount recited as an element used to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to \u20ac[...***...]. Bellicum shall have [...***...] days to tender a firm Purchase Order for the purchase of such shortfall to satisfy the Minimum Purchase requirements set forth above. If Bellicum fails to tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [...***...]-day period, then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicum's receipt of written notice of Miltenyi's election to do so, shall have no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:\n\n(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;\n\n(2) to use [...***...] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalf of Bellicum; and\n\n(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3.\n\nMinimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicable Forecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi and Bellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment.\n\nARTICLE 6 DELIVERY\n\n6.1 Delivery; Shipment.\n\n(a) Each quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in a particular Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered FCA (Incoterms 2010) Miltenyi's Facility by delivery\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nof the shipped goods to Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, in adequate packaging and ready for loading, on the Delivery Date (\"Delivery\").\n\n(b) Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum's designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a \"Delivery Date\") confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination and import customs clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum's written request, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum's responsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the following costs and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.\n\n(c) Upon Delivery, Bellicum will cause its carrier to verify the gross and visually observable physical integrity of all Miltenyi Product packaging prior to loading and to acknowledge proper receipt of the Miltenyi Products by signing the relevant transport documentation.\n\n(d) Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products appropriately labelled with a traceable lot or batch number and packaged for shipping in commercial packaging materials in compliance with Agreed Standards, Miltenyi's standard procedures and, the applicable Quality Agreement.\n\n(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from the quantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums' prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to a variance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only be invoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee. In the event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but not actually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, then Bellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay.\n\n6.2 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to Miltenyi Products shall pass to Bellicum as defined by Incoterm FCA (Incoterms 2010). Should any of the Delivered Miltenyi Products be damaged during transit to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4, a replacement order to replace such damaged Miltenyi Products shall be fulfilled, even if the volume limitations defined in Section 5.2 are exceeded, by Miltenyi in good faith and as soon as practicable (and such replacement order shall be considered a new Purchase Order during the applicable Firm Zone).\n\n6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum's specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to be separately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments, Miltenyi will pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments.\n\n6.4 Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.\n\n6.5 Certificates. Miltenyi shall include proper release certificates, certificates of compliance, and/or certificates of analysis with all shipments of Miltenyi Product, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement.\n\n6.6 Product Shortage. Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of any potential or anticipated shortfall in the manufacturing or inventory of any Miltenyi Product that may adversely affect the Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with Bellicum's forecast requirements and pending Purchase Orders therefor. If Miltenyi is unable to supply any Miltenyi Product subject to a pending Purchase Order for any reason, then the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery and Miltenyi shall undertake prompt and diligent efforts to mitigate the adverse impact on Bellicum. In the case of a limited availability of any Miltenyi Product, in selling such Miltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall take into account the aggregate volume of Miltenyi Products purchased by Bellicum, and shall subject to reasonable ethical standards provide to Bellicum priority access to Miltenyi Product consistent with such Miltenyi Product purchase volumes and critical medical needs. If due to the fault or error of Miltenyi or a Third-Party supplier or Subcontractor of Miltenyi or Force Majeure, Miltenyi fails to deliver any Miltenyi Product in the quantities specified in Bellicum's Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall use all [...***...] that may be necessary in order to minimize the shortfall, and deliver the ordered Miltenyi Product as soon as possible. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery or if the delay is more than thirty (30) days following the confirmed Delivery Date, Bellicum may, at its reasonable election and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, cancel the Purchase Order(s) without penalty.\n\n6.7 Continuity of Supply.\n\n(a) Contingent upon Bellicum's continued adherence to its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including the Forecast obligations and Firm Zone Requirements pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 above, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] have and devote adequate manufacturing capacity to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Belicum in accordance with the Forecasts during the Term, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7. However, Miltenyi's compliance with this Section 6.7(a) shall not require Miltenyi to incur any significant expenses to purchase new equipment, to install equipment purchased or requested by Bellicum, or to add (or, for clarity, allocate or dedicate) additional manufacturing or storage capacity for the manufacturing and supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum hereunder.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it will not be able, or is likely not to be able, to produce all of Bellicum's forecast requirements of Miltenyi Products from its primary facility located in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, Miltenyi shall determine, at its option and expense, to establish additional or alternative manufacturing and supply capability for the Miltenyi Products by qualifying and maintaining one or more back-up manufacturing facilities at the premises of Miltenyi and/or any of its Affiliates (each, a \"Secondary Location\"). Use of a Secondary Location must be notified to Bellicum in writing in accordance with the Change Notification processes set forth in Section 3.2. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reasonable number of samples of the \"Secondary Location Miltenyi Products\" (meaning such Miltenyi Products that are produced at such Secondary Location) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as each such Secondary Location Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. In the event that Miltenyi decides to qualify a Secondary Location for the supply of Miltenyi Products hereunder, it shall provide reasonable prior written notice thereof (not less than\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsix (6) months in advance) to Bellicum, including such details as Bellicum reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Secondary Location. Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for all activities in connection with the setup and approval of the Secondary Location, including for establishing proof of product equivalence for Miltenyi Products produced at the Secondary Location, process and equipment validation and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authorities in connection with the Secondary Location.\n\n(c) In addition, Miltenyi may from time to time determine, in its sole discretion, to have one or more Miltenyi Products manufactured, assembled and/or supplied, in whole or in part, by a Subcontractor chosen by Miltenyi and reasonably acceptable to Bellicum. Miltenyi shall provide Bellicum with prior written notification of such Change in accordance with the applicable notification procedures as set forth in the Section Change Control and in the Quality Agreement, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miltenyi shall remain responsible for the fulfilment of its supply and other obligations hereunder with respect to any Miltenyi Product manufactured by Miltenyi's Subcontractor. Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a Third Party subcontractor site for the Miltenyi Products. Further, Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for all process and equipment validation required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities\n\n(d) In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or more Miltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product that require a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventory shall be reserved for Bellicum.\n\n6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase.\n\nIf a given Module involves supply of Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's Commercial Phase activities, Section 6.8(b) shall apply, provided that additional terms and conditions regarding continuity of supply for such Commercial Phase activities pursuant to such Module have been negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon in such Module. The Parties acknowledge that provisions in such Module relating to additional terms and conditions regarding such continuity of supply will depend on the specific Miltenyi Product(s) that are relevant to such Module, and further acknowledge that such provision(s) in such Module may be subject to the Parties' good faith negotiation and mutual agreement regarding additional terms and conditions relevant to minimum purchase requirements (if any) for Miltenyi Product(s) under a Module.\n\n(a) Principal Terms.\n\n(1) In the event of a Supply Failure (as defined below), Bellicum shall have the option to request Miltenyi to establish, as soon as reasonably feasible and at Miltenyi's sole cost and expense, a Secondary Location reasonably capable of making up the Supply Failure of the affected Miltenyi Product (the \"Affected Miltenyi Product\"), and if Miltenyi should either (i) notify Bellicum in writing that it is not willing and/or capable to establish a Secondary Location, or (ii) should not have established such Secondary Location and made up the Supply Failure within a reasonable period of time with regard to the Affected Miltenyi Product from receipt of Bellicum's written request therefore, then Bellicum shall, at Bellicum's sole cost and expense, have the right to select, qualify, and maintain an additional second source manufacturing facility as a back-up manufacturing facility for the Affected Miltenyi Products at the premises of a Third Party (the \"Second-Source Supplier\"). In the event that Bellicum elects to qualify a Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product, it shall provide Miltenyi with prior written notice to Miltenyi including such details as Miltenyi reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall be subject to the prior written consent of Miltenyi, which\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in Miltenyi's reasonable judgment to protect the bona fide and legitimate interests of Miltenyi in protecting its proprietary Intellectual Property Rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., by disclosure to a Miltenyi Competitor). If Miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative Second-Source Suppliers reasonably acceptable to both Miltenyi and Bellicum. If the Parties fail to identify a mutually acceptable Second-Source Supplier within thirty (30) days, Bellicum may proceed with an alternative Second-Source Supplier of its choice (however not a Miltenyi Competitor) without Miltenyi's consent.\n\n(2) For purposes hereof, each of the following events shall be deemed a \"Supply Failure\":\n\n(i) if Miltenyi, using [...***...], fails to deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order of Miltenyi Product placed by Bellicum in accordance with the relevant binding Forecast within a reasonable period of time after the agreed Delivery Date therefor (whether by reason of Force Majeure or otherwise) more than twice during any Calendar Year; provided, however, that any of the foregoing events shall not be considered a Supply Failure to the extent that it results from:\n\n(x) an act or omission of Bellicum, including any specific written instructions or requirements issued by Bellicum, including an Bellicum- Requested Change; or\n\n(y) the failure or delay on the part of any supplier of materials designated and required by Bellicum or any other Subcontractor designated and required by Bellicum; or\n\n(z) a Required Change or other change in any material requirement relating to the development, manufacturing, packaging and shipping of Miltenyi Product at Miltenyi's facility required by Applicable Laws, or the imposition of any other condition with respect to the Miltenyi Product by any governmental body or agency, or Regulatory Authority, based on Applicable Laws, or an event of Force Majeure, unless Miltenyi fails to use [...***...] to remedy the failure, inability, or delay within a reasonable period of time. In the event of the foregoing failures, inabilities, or delays, the Parties shall meet and discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(ii) If Miltenyi fails to Deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order, then for that Miltenyi Product affected by such failed Delivery, the next step in the Discount scheme set forth in Exhibit F shall be applied to such Miltenyi Product during the following two (2) Calendar Quarters (and a repeated failure shall result in further step in the Discount scheme being applied in like manner).\n\n(3) In the event that Bellicum selects a Second-Source Supplier over Miltenyi's reasonable objection, Miltenyi shall not be responsible to Bellicum for the performance of the said Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall, as a condition of qualification, provide reasonable and customary undertakings to Miltenyi related to the protection of Miltenyi's Confidential Information. Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable cooperation and assistance, for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a manufacturing facility as Second-Source Supplier for Affected Miltenyi Product. Further, Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable assistance, for all process and equipment validation\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nrequired by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(4) In the event of a Supply Failure, Miltenyi shall grant Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, one-site production license, without the right to sublicense, under Miltenyi's Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent reasonably necessary to manufacture the Affected Miltenyi Product for the Permitted Use by Bellicum at Bellicum's cost. For the avoidance of doubt, a Second-Source Supplier's license under this subsection shall not permit the manufacture of any Miltenyi Product that is not subject to Supply Failure. A Second-Source Supplier's license hereunder shall subsist until such time as Miltenyi and Bellicum reach agreement on alternative license and/or supply arrangements which shall, inter alia, take into consideration: (i) Miltenyi's interest in regaining control over the manufacture of Miltenyi Products, (ii) Bellicum's interest in securing continuity of supply of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s), (iii) the costs incurred by Bellicum in establishing the Second-Source Supplier to rectify the applicable Supply Failure, (iv) the avoidance of potential adverse effects (supply disruption) that may result from the transfer of manufacturing back to Miltenyi, and (v) the appropriate sharing of costs resulting from the Supply Failure.\n\n(5) In furtherance of the Second-Source Supplier's license grant pursuant to subsection (4) above, Miltenyi shall, to the extent reasonably necessary:\n\n(i) provide the Second-Source Supplier, subject to a non-disclosure agreement on terms no less restrictive than those set forth herein, with prompt access to the documentation, protocols, assays, SOPs, materials, including biological materials, and other know-how and information constituting the manufacturing process of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s);\n\n(ii) assist the Second-Source Supplier with the working up and use of Miltenyi's technology, including providing a reasonable level of technical assistance and consultation;\n\n(iii) provide the Second-Source Supplier with additional disclosures of information and technical assistance and consultation as necessary to keep the Second-Source Supplier informed of the then-current Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights and the then-current manufacturing process(es) for the Affected Miltenyi Product(s); and\n\n(iv) provide such other assistance to Bellicum and the Second-Source Supplier as may be reasonably required to give effect to such license.\n\n(6) Unless Miltenyi is in material breach, Bellicum will pay for work requested by Bellicum and conducted by or on behalf of Miltenyi, and reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi, in establishing and maintaining Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product.\n\nARTICLE 7 ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION.\n\n7.1 Acceptance Testing. Bellicum or (for Miltenyi Product purchased by Bellicum but shipped directly to a Bellicum's Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee) Bellicum's designated recipient of the\n\nshipment of Miltenyi Product will promptly upon Delivery visually inspect each shipment of Miltenyi Product delivered hereunder to (i) determine whether such Miltenyi Product is damaged and (ii) verify that the quantity of Miltenyi Product delivered conforms with the Purchase Order and other applicable documentation. Further, Bellicum shall have a period of [...***...] days from the date of Delivery to\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nperform, or have its Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee (as the case may be) perform, incoming quality assurance testing on each shipment of Miltenyi Product in accordance with the Bellicum-approved quality control testing procedures as set forth in the Product Specifications or the Quality Agreement, as applicable (the \"Testing Methods\"), to verify conformance with the Product Specifications. For the avoidance of doubt, Bellicum shall have no obligation under this Section 7.1 to inspect or test the contents of the Miltenyi Products other than as in accordance with the agreed Testing Methods, save as prescribed by Applicable Laws.\n\n7.2 Rejection. Bellicum or its designee shall have the right to reject any shipment of Miltenyi Products that does not conform with the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty at the time of Delivery when tested in accordance with the Testing Methods (each, a \"Rejected Product\"). Except in the case of latent defects as described in Section 7.3, each shipment of Miltenyi Products shall be deemed accepted by Bellicum if Bellicum or its designated recipient of the shipment does not provide Miltenyi with written notice of rejection (a \"Rejection Notice\") within [...***...] days from the date of receipt of the relevant shipment of Miltenyi Product, describing the reasons for the rejection and the non-conforming characteristics of such Rejected Product in reasonable detail. Once a Delivery of Miltenyi Products is accepted or deemed accepted hereunder, Bellicum shall have no recourse against Miltenyi in the event any such Miltenyi Product is subsequently deemed unsuitable for use for any reason, except for Miltenyi Product that does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty after said 30-day period due to a latent defect in the Miltenyi Product that could not be detected through the performance of the Testing Methods.\n\n7.3 Latent Defects. Bellicum shall have the further right to reject such quantities of Miltenyi Product accepted or deemed accepted pursuant to Section 7.2 above by providing a Rejection Notice on the grounds that all or part of the shipment fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty to the extent such non-conformance could not have reasonably been determined by visual inspection or incoming quality assurance testing in accordance with Section 7.1, provided that the applicable shelf-life of the Miltenyi Product has not expired and such non-conformance is unrelated to the shipping or storage of the Miltenyi Product after Delivery. The rejection provisions of Section 7.2 above shall apply. Notification to Miltenyi by Bellicum must occur within [...***...] days after Bellicum or Bellicum's designated recipient of the shipment becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware that the Miltenyi Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty.\n\n7.4 Confirmation. After its receipt of a Rejection Notice from Bellicum or its designee pursuant to Section 7.2, Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in writing as soon as reasonably practical whether or not it accepts Bellicum's basis for rejection, and Bellicum shall reasonably cooperate with Miltenyi in determining in good faith whether such rejection was necessary or justified. Upon Miltenyi's reasonable request, Bellicum shall provide, or cause its designees to provide, (i) evidence of appropriate transport, storage and handling for any Rejected Product in accordance with the storage and handling instructions set forth in the applicable Product Specifications; and (ii) reasonable testing data demonstrating that the Miltenyi Product in question does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty. If the Parties are unable to agree as to whether a shipment of Miltenyi Products supplied by Miltenyi hereunder conforms to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, such question shall be submitted to an independent quality control laboratory mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The findings of such independent quality control laboratory shall be binding upon the Parties. The cost of the independent quality control laboratory shall be borne by the Party whose results are shown by such laboratory to have been incorrect.\n\n7.5 Return or Destruction of Rejected Products. Bellicum may not return or destroy any batch of Miltenyi Products until it receives written notification from Miltenyi that Miltenyi does not dispute that such batch fails to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty. Miltenyi will indicate in its notice either that Bellicum is authorized to destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products, or that Miltenyi requires return of the rejected Miltenyi Products. Upon written authorization from Miltenyi to do so, Bellicum shall promptly destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products and provide Miltenyi with written certification of\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsuch destruction. Upon receipt of Miltenyi's request for return, Bellicum shall promptly return the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products to Miltenyi. In each case, Miltenyi will reimburse Bellicum for the documented, reasonable costs associated with the destruction or return of the rejected Miltenyi Products.\n\n7.6 Replacement or Refund. Bellicum shall not be required to pay any invoice with respect to any shipment of Miltenyi Products properly rejected pursuant to this Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bellicum shall be obligated to pay in full for any rejected shipment of Miltenyi Products that is not returned or destroyed in accordance with Section 7.5 above, and that is subsequently determined to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, irrespective of whether Bellicum has already paid Miltenyi for a replacement shipment (but in such event, the replacement shipment will be Delivered to Bellicum and will be included in Bellicum's Minimum Purchases). If Bellicum pays in full for a shipment of Miltenyi Products and subsequently properly rejects such shipment in accordance with Section 7.2, Bellicum shall be entitled, upon confirmation that such shipment failed to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, either, at Bellicum's option: (i) to a refund or credit equal to the Product Price paid with respect to such rejected shipment (including without limitation, taxes paid and shipping expenses); or (ii) to require Miltenyi to promptly replace and Deliver to Bellicum an amount of Miltenyi Products that conforms to the requirements of this Agreement at no additional cost to Bellicum. Bellicum acknowledges and agrees that Bellicum's rights to a refund or credit for, or to receive replacement of, properly rejected shipments of Miltenyi Products hereunder shall be Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy, and Miltenyi's sole obligation, with respect to non-conforming Miltenyi Products delivered hereunder.\n\n7.7 Exceptions. Bellicum's rights of rejection, return, refund and replacement set forth in this Article 7 shall not apply to any Miltenyi Product that is non-conforming due to damage (i) caused by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, or Licensees or their respective employees or agents, including but not limited to, misuse, neglect, improper storage, transportation or use beyond any dating provided, or (ii) that occurs after Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with this Agreement, including any damage caused thereafter by accident, fire or other hazard, and Miltenyi shall have no liability or responsibility to Bellicum with respect thereto.\n\nARTICLE 8 FINANCIAL TERMS\n\n8.1 Upfront Payment. Following execution of this Agreement and within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of an invoice therefor, and as consideration for (i) the right to use certain Miltenyi Products for human use, including the right to cross-reference to the Master File(s) and Miltenyi's additional filings in connection with such Master File(s) as described in Article 4; (ii) Miltenyi's obligation to supply certain Miltenyi Products for human clinical trials and commercialized human use; and (iii) Miltenyi's support of Bellicum's development and commercialization efforts regarding Bellicum Products, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi a non-refundable upfront fee in the aggregate amount of two million Euro (\u20ac2,000,000) (the \"Upfront Fee\"). The Upfront Fee will be paid in installments, as follows: (a) a first installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following execution of this Agreement; (b) a second installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following the first anniversary of the Effective Date.\n\n8.2 Milestone Payments. For each particular Bellicum Product, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi [...***...], one-time only milestone payments of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]) each, [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], and [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], or [...***...], whatever comes earlier, respectively, of such Bellicum Product, as set forth in such Bellicum Product's or Bellicum Program corresponding Module(s).\n\n8.3 Third Party Fees and Royalties. Bellicum will reimburse Miltenyi for Third Party royalties and/or license fees, if any, owed by Miltenyi under Third Party license agreements existing as of the Effective Date as set forth on Exhibit D solely to the extent Miltenyi's exercise of rights under such licenses is required\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nto supply Miltenyi Product to Bellicum under this Agreement for the Permitted Use; and further provided that amounts owed under such Third Party license agreements have not otherwise been passed through to Bellicum and are actually paid by Miltenyi to Miltenyi's licensor(s). Bellicum acknowledges that the potential volume of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees under applicable Third Party license agreements will be as set forth on Exhibit D, as updated from time to time by Miltenyi. If, during the Term of this Agreement, the Parties mutually agree to obtain additional Third Party licenses to enable the Permitted Use of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, and/or Licensees under this Agreement, and such additional licenses give rise to Third Party royalties and/or license fees with respect to Bellicum's use of Miltenyi Products under this Agreement, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith which Party(ies) is/are responsible for payment of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees. Miltenyi, acting reasonably, reserves the right to defer the inclusion of additional Miltenyi Products in Exhibit B hereto until the Parties have reached agreement on this matter.\n\n8.4 Pricing\n\n(a) Product Price. In consideration of the supply and Delivery of Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement, Miltenyi agrees to sell and Deliver and Bellicum agrees to purchase Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement at the Purchase Price listed for each unit of a Miltenyi Product set forth on Exhibit E (the \"Product Price\").\n\n(b) Tiered Pricing. Bellicum shall be entitled to a reduction of the Product Prices set forth in Exhibit F (collectively, the \"Discounts\"). The Discount, as applicable to a particular Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year, shall be based on Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' consolidated volume purchases of such Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year. Within the first Calendar Year, Miltenyi shall analyze Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' purchases of Miltenyi Products at the end of each Calendar Quarter; if such purchases for a particular Miltenyi Product exceed the volume threshold of the then applicable Discount (based on binding and firm Purchase Orders received by Miltenyi in that Calendar Quarter), then, in the following Calendar Quarter, for all Purchase Orders regarding such Miltenyi Product, the corresponding higher Discount level in accordance with the volume thresholds as defined in Exhibit F shall apply. Subject to Bellicum reaching the Minimum Purchase requirements in accordcance with Section 5.6 in a Calendar Year, for the subsequent Calandar Year, the Discount applicable for the first Discount volume threshold shall apply, beginning from the first Miltenyi Product ordered by Bellicum under this Agreement during such subsequent Calendar Year.\n\n(c) Purchase Price Adjustments. Miltenyi shall be entitled to modify the Purchase Price for any Miltenyi Product as set forth in Section 8.3(a) above and Exhibit E on or after the commencement of each Calendar Year during the Term after Contract Year 1 in accordance with this Section 8.4(c), provided that there shall not be more than one (1) Purchase Price increase with respect to the same Miltenyi Product in any given Contract Year during the Term. In case, after application of the applicable Discount, any Purchase Price increases [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) annually, then the Parties shall consult each other, negotiate in good faith and agree in writing upon an adaptation of the applicable Discount to stay within the capping of a [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) increase, except for cases when such Purchase Price increase is the result of a documented increase of more than [...***...] ([...***...]%) in the cost of any raw materials, packaging and/or other components used in the manufacture of Miltenyi Product and Miltenyi, at Bellicum's request, has provided reasonable documentation evidencing such changes in production costs. It is however expressly agreed between the Parties that the adjusted Purchase Price charged to Bellicum for Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder shall in no event exceed Miltenyi's then-current list prices for such Miltenyi Product as in effect in the country of destination or use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, as published from time to time in Miltenyi's applicable product catalogue.\n\n(d) Product Price Adjustments resulting from Changes. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on Product Price increases set forth in Section 8.3(c) above shall not apply to\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nProduct Price adjustments resulting from a Required Change or a Bellicum-Requested Change pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereof.\n\n8.5 Payment Terms. The payment terms for all payments made by Bellicum for purchased Miltenyi Products shall be as follows:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all undisputed and properly due payments are payable within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of each invoice corresponding to a shipment of Miltenyi Products by Miltenyi, such invoices to be issued by Miltenyi or the applicable Miltenyi Affiliate in the Forecast Territory.\n\n(b) Bellicum shall make all payments by wire transfer or electronic fund transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Miltenyi or its local Affiliate in the Forecast Territory, as applicable. All payments by Bellicum to Miltenyi or its Affiliate (as the case may be) under this Agreement shall be made in the local currency that applies to the Miltenyi company that is assigned to fulfill the respective Purchase Order for Miltenyi Products.\n\n(c) All sums payable by Bellicum under this Agreement are stated exclusive of sales tax and VAT.\n\n(d) Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi reserves the right to assess a late fee equal to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) per month, or if lower, the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, on all undisputed and properly due amounts not paid by Bellicum when due. Bellicum acknowledges that failure by Bellicum to comply with its payment obligations in this Article 8 shall constitute a material breach.\n\n(e) Except as expressly provided herein, Bellicum shall not exercise any right of setoff, net-out or deduction, take any credit, or otherwise reduce the balance owed to Miltenyi with respect to any payments under this Agreement, unless the Parties otherwise agree or until Bellicum has obtained a final and non-appealable judgment against Miltenyi in the amount asserted by Bellicum.\n\n8.6 Taxes. All payments made under this Agreement shall be free and clear of any and all taxes, duties, levies, fees or other charges, except for withholding taxes. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct from its payment to the other Party under this Agreement the amount of any withholding taxes required to be withheld, to the extent paid to the appropriate governmental authority on behalf of the other Party (and not refunded or reimbursed). Each Party shall deliver to the other Party, upon request, proof of payment of all such withholding taxes. Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the other Party in seeking any benefits available to such Party with respect to government tax withholdings by any relevant law, regulation or double tax treaty.\n\n8.7 Right to Suspend. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi shall have the right to suspend its performance under this Agreement if and to the extent Bellicum materially fails to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such failure within five Business Days after confirmed receipt of a notice of breach from Miltenyi. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by Bellicum to make timely payments of any material, undisputed amount that is properly due Miltenyi under this Agreement shall constitute a material failure of Bellicum to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Bellicum, Bellicum shall have the right to suspend payment under this Agreement if and to the extent Miltenyi materially fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 9 INSPECTION\n\n9.1 Facility Audits. Upon commercially reasonable notice (to be provided not less than [...***...] days in advance) and during Miltenyi's normal business hours, but not more often than once every [...***...] months, except for cause, during the Term of this Agreement, Bellicum or Bellicum's Licensees duly authorized agents, representatives or designees may inspect those portions of Miltenyi's Facilities that are used to manufacture, store or conduct testing of Miltenyi Products to determine compliance with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and the applicable Quality Agreement. Such representatives shall comply with the applicable rules and regulations for workers at such Facilities and shall enter into reasonable confidentiality and non-use agreements if so requested by Miltenyi, as a representative of Bellicum or such Licensee (and not in an individual capacity). All audits shall be conducted in a manner that is intended to minimize disruption to the operations at such Facilities. Miltenyi shall promptly address and correct any deviations from Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and/or the provisions of the applicable Quality Agreement identified in connection with such inspections.\n\n9.2 Exempt Documentation. Miltenyi reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to exempt certain documentation from such audit described in Section 9.1 if and to the extent this is reasonably required in order to protect Miltenyi's trade secrets in Miltenyi Technology and/or other Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights or Third Party Intellectual Property rights. If such exemption will have a material impact on the scope of a representative's inspection, the Parties will discuss in good faith other means to provide sufficient information to such representative.\n\n9.3 Inspection by Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall permit inspections of the Miltenyi Facility by Regulatory Authorities and shall respond to any notices or requests for information by Regulatory Authorities for any import or export license, registration or pending registration for manufacturing of Miltenyi Products during the Term of the Agreement. Miltenyi shall permit representatives of any applicable Regulatory Authority to access, at any reasonable time during normal business hours, any and all relevant records and information, personnel and facilities. To the extent that a Regulatory Authority raises any quality issue during or following a Regulatory Authority inspection that would Bellicumbe reasonably likely to adversely affect the suitability of the Miltenyi Products for any Permitted Use, Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum in writing of such issue. The Parties will promptly give written notice to each other in advance of any scheduled inspection of Miltenyi's Facility by a Regulatory Authority.\n\n9.4 Cost of Audits and Inspections. If Bellicum or or Bellicum's Licensees conduct a Facility audit or inspection more than [...***...] in a [...***...] month period, and such additional audits are not \"for cause\" audits, then Bellicum and its Licensees (as applicable) shall reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a direct result of Facility audits and/or inspections pursuant to Sections 9.1and 9.3 solely to the extent that they relate to the review of a Bellicum Product. For clarity, Bellicum shall not be liable, in any event, for any costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi to correct deficiencies of Miltenyi manufacturing procedures in order to comply with: 1) Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws, the applicable Quality Agreement and Product Specifications; 2) inspection of a Miltenyi Product in general; and 3) inspection of a Third Party product.\n\nARTICLE 10 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\n10.1 Existing Intellectual Property. Except as the Parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, each Party shall continue to own all rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and title to its Technology existing as of the Effective Date or developed during the Term but outside the scope of this Agreement, without conferring any interests therein on the other Party. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, as between the Parties, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Miltenyi owns and shall continue to own all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Miltenyi Technology included in the Miltenyi Products supplied to Bellicum, and Bellicum shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Miltenyi Technology by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, and (ii) Bellicum owns or\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncontrols and shall continue to own and control all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof), and Miltenyi shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof) by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n10.2 Limited License. Miltenyi hereby grants to Bellicum, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited non-exclusive right and license under the Miltenyi Technology incorporated or embodied in the Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder), solely to use such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use. The foregoing license shall be sub-licensable through multiple tiers to Licensees of Bellicum and to Bellicum's and its Licensees' respective Subcontractors (but not to Miltenyi Competitors) solely in conjunction with the use of such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use, provided however that Subcontractors shall not have the right to grant sublicenses under Miltenyi Technology). For the avoidance of doubt, the license granted to Bellicum under this Section 10.2 conveys no right to Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees to use Miltenyi Technology to make, have made, import, have imported, offer for sale and/or sell any Miltenyi Product.\n\n10.3 Notification. Miltenyi will promptly notify Bellicum in writing of Miltenyi's receipt of any written claim or demand from any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights, or Miltenyi's receipt of written notice of the initiation of any legal action or other legal proceeding by any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n10.4 Disclaimer. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted, either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, as: (i) a grant, transfer or other conveyance by either Party to the other of any right, title, license or other interest of any kind in any portion of its Technology or Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) creating an obligation on the part of either Party to make any such grant, transfer or other conveyance.\n\nARTICLE 11 WARRANTIES\n\n11.1 Miltenyi Product Warranty.

Bellicum's remedies and Miltenyi liability with respect to this Miltenyi Product Warranty are set forth in Section 7.6 and as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n\n11.2 Additional Miltenyi Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. Miltenyi further represents and warrants and covenants to Bellicum that:\n\n(1) Miltenyi and its Affiliates and Subcontractors have the scientific, technical and other requisite competencies, and full right and power to perform the obligations set forth in this Agreement, and Miltenyi covenants that during the Term of this Agreement it will not enter into any obligation owed to a Third Party that would materially impair Miltenyi's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement (including Miltenyi's obligation to supply Miltenyi Products to Bellicum);\n\n(2) To Miltenyi's knowledge and after due inquiry, on the Effective Date, Miltenyi owns all right, title, and interest in and to, or otherwise possesses all necessary rights and licenses under, the Miltenyi Technology and the Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights, to perform its obligations under this Agreement;\n\n(3) As of the Effective Date, Miltenyi has not received any written communication from any Third Party alleging that the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of any Miltenyi Product infringes any Third Party patent or misappropriates any other Third Party Intellectual Property Rights; and\n\n(4) To Miltenyi's knowledge on the Effective Date, except with respect to the agreements listed on Exhibit D hereto there are no agreements between Miltenyi and a Third Party that would impose any payment obligation on Bellicum with respect to the use of Miltenyi Product in connection with the manufacture, use or sale of any Bellicum Product, or any Bellicum use within the Permitted Use.\n\n11.3 Bellicum Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. Bellicum represents, warrants and covenants to Miltenyi that:\n\n(1) Bellicum has the scientific, technical and other requisite competencies to determine the suitability of each Miltenyi Product purchased hereunder for the use to which Bellicum will put such Miltenyi Product;\n\n(2) As of the Effective Date, the Product Specifications are adequate to confirm the suitability of the Miltenyi Product (including its packaging and labelling) for the uses to which such Miltenyi Product will be put by Bellicum;\n\n(3) Bellicum will perform, and will cause its Subcontractors and Licensees to perform, sufficient incoming inspection of each supplied Miltenyi Product to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and under all Applicable Laws; and\n\n(4) Bellicum shall manufacture (and require and ensure that any Subcontractor or Licensee will manufacture) Bellicum Products using appropriate standards of care and quality in accordance with Applicable Laws and all requirements of Regulatory Authorities applicable to such manufacture; and\n\n(5) Bellicum shall use, and will cause its Subcontractors and Licensees to use, Miltenyi Products in accordance with all Applicable Laws and all requirements of Regulatory Authorities applicable to such use.\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n11.4 Disclaimer.\n\n(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF PATENTS, OR THE PROSPECTS OR LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF PRODUCT.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the generality of clause (a) above, Miltenyi hereby expressly disclaims any warranty that (i) the Miltenyi Products will be suitable for the development or manufacturing of a Bellicum Product, or (ii) Bellicum's intended use of the Miltenyi Products for the development or manufacturing of Bellicum Product will be approved by any Regulatory Authority, or (iii) the Miltenyi Products will otherwise be suitable in any respect for a Permitted Use or be commercially exploitable or profitable.\n\n(c) In no event shall Miltenyi or its Affiliates be responsible or liable for any non-conformance or other defects in the Miltenyi Product(s), including any non-conformance with the warranties in Section 11.1 and 11.2, to the extent resulting from improper use, handling, storage, transportation, or disposal of the Miltenyi Product(s) after Delivery thereof (including without limitation failure to use the Miltenyi Product(s) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Product Specifications), accident, or from any other cause not attributable to defective workmanship or failure to meet the Miltenyi Product Warranty on the part of Miltenyi or its Affiliates.\n\n(d) Miltenyi's warranty under Section 11.2 does not relate to the potential uses of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees in relation to Third Party rights, even if foreseeable.

If Miltenyi fails to negotiate such license or modify the applicable Miltenyi Product, and to the extent Bellicum reasonably determines, following consultation with Miltenyi, that it is obligated to take a royalty-bearing license under any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights in order to avoid infringement of such Third Party Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall have the right to offset any payment actually made to the Third Party for such license in any Contract Year against any Product Price payable to Miltenyi for the applicable Miltenyi Product in the same\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nContract Year (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis), under the proviso that Bellicum provides Miltenyi with reasonably satisfactory evidence of such Third Party royalties payment.

Except for liability for (i) breach of the confidentiality obligations described in Article 14, (ii) misappropriation or infringement by a Party of the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights, or (iii) gross negligence or willful misconduct:\n\n(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS OR BREACH OF WARRANTY), EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES;\n\n(b) EACH PARTY'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT AND ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO ONE EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT PRICES PAID BY BELLICUM FOR THE MILTENYI PRODUCT(S) DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY DURING SUCH PERIOD ALSO SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PARTY'S INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY.\n\n12.2 No Liability for Clinical Trials. Bellicum shall have sole responsibility that any Bellicum Product is safe for human use, and Bellicum hereby assumes sole risk and liability arising out of or in connection with the use of Bellicum Products in clinical trials by or on behalf of Bellicum or commercialization of Bellicum Products (including product liability with respect thereto).\n\nARTICLE 13 INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE\n\n13.1 Indemnification by Miltenyi. Miltenyi will save, defend and hold harmless Bellicum, its Licensees and Subcontractors and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, \"Bellicum Indemnitees\") from and against any and all liability, damage, loss or expense (collectively, \"Losses\") to which any such Bellicum Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Miltenyi of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement; or (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Miltenyi Indemnitee (as defined below); except, in each case, to the extent that such Losses result from the material breach by Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee. In the event Bellicum seeks indemnification under this Section\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n13.1, Bellicum shall (a) notify Miltenyi in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Miltenyi is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Miltenyi to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Miltenyi shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.1, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Miltenyi's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Miltenyi may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of an authorized representative of Bellicum.\n\n13.2 Indemnification by Bellicum. Bellicum will save, defend and hold harmless Miltenyi, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, \"Miltenyi Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Losses to which any such Miltenyi Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement; (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee (as defined above); or (iii) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of any Bellicum Product by or on behalf of Bellicum; except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the material breach by Miltenyi of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Miltenyi Indemnitee. In the event Miltenyi seeks indemnification under this Section 13.2, Miltenyi shall (a) notify Bellicum in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Bellicum is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Bellicum to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Bellicum shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.2, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Bellicum's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Bellicum may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of Miltenyi.\n\n13.3 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.\n\n13.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate amount of commercial general liability and product liability insurance throughout the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto upon such terms (including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the industry for the products supplied or activities to be conducted by such Party under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, such Bellicum liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Bellicum Product, and such Miltenyi liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of use of a Miltenyi Product in the manufacture of a Bellicum Product. In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party shall increase their levels of insurance coverage if reasonably deemed prudent by such Party in light of the overall products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 14 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n14.1 Definition. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\" or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) calendar days after its oral disclosure, which is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosing Party's failure to so mark any of its Confidential Information, whether disclosed in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form, or its failure to designate as confidential and reduce to writing any Confidential Information disclosed orally, shall not relieve the Receiving Party of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information if its confidential nature would be apparent to a reasonable person in the biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industry, based on the subject matter of such Confidential Information or the circumstances under which it is disclosed.\n\n14.2 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. During the Term and for five (5) years thereafter, each of Miltenyi and Bellicum shall keep Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence and shall not (i) use the other Party's Confidential Information for any use or purpose except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing in advance by the other Party, or (ii) disclose the other Party's Confidential Information to anyone other than those of its Affiliates, Subcontractors, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, collaborators and consultants, and in the case of Bellicum, its Licensees (collectively, \"Authorized Representatives\") who need to know such Confidential Information for a use or purpose expressly permitted under this Agreement. Each Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, each Receiving Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature (but not less than reasonable measures) and shall ensure that any Authorized Representative of the Receiving Party who is permitted access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party pursuant to clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 14.2 is contractually or legally bound by obligations of non-disclosure and non-use in scope and content at least as protective of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the provisions hereof prior to any disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to such Authorized Representative. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Representatives.\n\n14.3 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the above, a Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Article 14 with regard to any information of the Disclosing Party which the Receiving Party can demonstrate through competent proof: (a) was generally known and available in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to the Receiving Party or becomes generally known and available in the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party or its Authorized Representatives; (b) can be documented as previously known by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by the Disclosing Party; (c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (e) becomes known to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; provided (i) only the specific information that meets the exclusions shall be excluded, and not any other information that happens to appear in proximity to such excluded portions (for example, a portion of a document may be excluded without affecting the confidential nature of those portions that do not themselves qualify for exclusion) or that happens to be disclosed at the same time or in connection therewith; and (ii) specific Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because of broader or related information being known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession, nor\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall combinations of elements or principles be considered to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because individual elements thereof are known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession.\n\n14.4 Permitted Disclosure.\n\n(a) Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is legally required or compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or judicial agency or body pursuant to proceedings over which such agency or body has jurisdiction; provided, however, that prior to making any such required or compelled disclosure, the Receiving Party shall: (i) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to such agency or body; (ii) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such order or requirement to disclose; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against or limiting any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order, confidential treatment and/or any other remedy narrowing the scope of the required or compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality. In the event that a protective order, confidential treatment and/or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement as applied to such required or compelled disclosure, then the Receiving Party may, without liability, disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to the extent that it is legally required or compelled to disclose. The Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that is legally required to disclose and will make all reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded to Confidential Information so disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 14.4(a) shall not alter the character of that information as Confidential Information hereunder.\n\n(b) Authorized Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement (i) in connection with the requirements of an initial public offering or securities filing; (ii) in confidence, to accountants, attorneys, other professional advisors, banks, and financing sources and their advisors; (iii) in confidence, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or rights under this Agreement; or (iv) in confidence, in connection with a merger or acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or a sale or proposed sale of its assets or business, or the like.\n\n14.5 Publicity. Each Party may disclose the existence of this Agreement, but agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws or regulations, neither Party shall make any public announcement or press release regarding this Agreement or any terms thereof, or otherwise use the name, logos, trademarks or products of the other Party in any publication, without the other Party's express prior written consent.\n\n14.6 Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Article 14 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Parties and are considered by the Parties to be reasonable for such purpose. Each Party agrees that any violation of this Article 14 by it or its Affiliate, or Subcontractors may cause substantial and irreparable harm to the other Party and, therefore, in the event of any violation or threatened violation of this Article 14 by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and other injunctive and equitable relief in addition to any other legal remedies available.\n\nARTICLE 15 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n15.1 Term. This Agreement shall enter into force on the Effective Date. The Agreement shall have an initial term of ten (10) years commencing from the Effective Date and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof (the \"Initial Term\"), unless earlier terminated by either Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.2 or Section 15.3. Thereafter, Bellicum shall have consecutive separate options to extend the Term for successive renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, a \"Renewal Term\", and\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncollectively with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"). Provided Bellicum is not then in default with its material obligations hereunder, Bellicum may exercise each such renewal option by giving written notice to Miltenyi not later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the current Term.\n\n15.2 Termination for Cause. Notwithstanding Section 15.1 either Party may, in addition to any other remedies available to it under this Agreement or by law, terminate this Agreement or any particular Module as follows:\n\n(a) Termination for Material Breach. A Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module by providing written notice to the other Party describing the other Party's material breach and demanding its cure, in the event that the other Party materially breaches a material provision of this Agreement or such Module and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice of the breach or, if the breach is not susceptible to cure within such thirty (30) day period, if the breaching Party fails to submit to the notifying Party and implement within such thirty (30) day period a written remedial action plan reasonably satisfactory to the notifying Party that sets out appropriate corrective action for remedying such breach promptly after such 30-day period expires.\n\n(b) Termination for Bankruptcy or Insolvency. A Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party shall have become insolvent or bankrupt, or shall have made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or there shall have been appointed a trustee or receiver of the other Party, or if any case or proceeding shall have been commenced or other action taken by or against the other Party in bankruptcy or seeking reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding- up, arrangement, composition or readjustment of its debts or any relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar act or law of any jurisdiction now or hereinafter in effect that is not dismissed within thirty (30) days after commencement.\n\n(c) Termination for Force Majeure. A Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module upon providing written notice to the other Party if the other Party is affected by a Force Majeure event which cannot be removed, overcome or abated within three (3) continuous months (or within such other period as the Parties jointly shall agree in writing) from the initial date of such Force Majeure event.\n\n15.3 Discontinuance or Suspension of Bellicum Product Program or Without Cause Termination. Bellicum may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module upon ninety (90) days written notice to Miltenyi: 1) if Bellicum, in its sole and absolute discretion, discontinues or indefinitely suspends the development and/or commercialization of the Bellicum Product(s) or 2) without cause for any reason or no reason. Upon the termination of this Agreement or such Module pursuant to this Section 15.3, Bellicum's sole obligation shall be for it to make payment of all undisputed and properly due amounts payable for Miltenyi Product ordered prior to the effective date of such termination of each terminated Module, including any Purchase Order to be made by Bellicum in connection with Bellicum's then- outstanding obligation to purchase quantities of Miltenyi Product forecasted with respect to an applicable Firm Zone. For clarity, termination of this Agreement or any Module pursuant to this Section 15.3 shall not release Bellicum from its payment obligations with respect to the quantities set forth in any Purchase Orders or quantities forecasted for any Firm Zone.\n\n15.4 Expiration or termination of this Agreement or a particular Module for any reason shall not release either Party from liability accrued under this Agreement or such Module, respectively, prior to such expiration or termination, nor preclude either Party from pursuing any rights or remedies accrued prior to such expiration or termination or accrued at law or in equity with respect to any uncured material breach of this Agreement or such Module.\n\n15.5 The termination of this Agreement or a particular Module shall not operate to relieve Bellicum from its obligation to pay undisputed and properly due amounts of (a) the Product Price of all\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nquantities of Miltenyi Products (i) delivered in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement up to the effective date of termination and (ii) to be delivered under outstanding Purchase Orders accepted by Miltenyi prior to the date of notice of termination (including the Ordered Quantities) or (iii) forecasted for any Firm Zone in the most recent applicable Monthly Forecast; (b) any Upfront Fee payable under Section 8.1 and any earned Milestone Fee payable under Section 8.2 hereof; and (c) all other undisputed and properly due fees and/or expenses owed to Miltenyi in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement prior to the date of notice of termination; provided, however, that in the event of termination of this Agreement or such Module(s) by Bellicum pursuant to Section 15.2 (Termination for Cause), Bellicum shall not be responsible for payments relating to any portion of the Forecast applicable to any period after the effective date of termination. All amounts paid under Sections 8.1 through 8.3 shall be non-refundable once paid.\n\n15.6 Post Termination. Upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return to the other Party or destroy, at the other Party's request,\n\n(a) any and all Confidential Information of the other Party then in its possession or control, except if such information is covered under surviving license rights, and further provided that each Party may keep one (1) copy of such information in its legal archives for regulatory compliance purposes and in order to determine its ongoing obligations hereunder, including in connection with legal proceedings; and such additional copies of or any computer records or files containing such Confidential Information that have been created solely by the Receiving Party's automatic archiving and back-up procedures, to the extent created and retained in a manner consistent with the Receiving Party's standard archiving and back-up procedures, but not for any other use or purpose; and\n\n(b) any and all remaining materials and capital equipment of the other Party then in its possession or control.\n\n15.7 Survival. Other than obligations which have accrued and are outstanding as of the date of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Quality Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, all rights granted and obligations undertaken by the Parties hereunder shall terminate immediately upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, subject to Section 15.4 above and except for the following which shall survive according to their terms: Section 2.2 (Permitted Use); Section 2.7 (Subcontracting by Bellicum); Article 10 (Intellectual Property); Article 11 (Warranty); Article 12 (Limitation of Liability); Article 13 (Indemnification; Insurance); Article 14 (Confidentiality and Non-disclosure); Section 15.7 (Post-termination); Section 15.7 (Survival); Article 16 (Notices); Article 17 (Assignment); Article 19 (Dispute Resolution and Applicable Law); and Article 20 (Miscellaneous); and any and all rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder, as well as any other provision hereunder which by its nature is intended to survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 16 NOTICES.\n\nAll notices, demands, requests, consents, approval and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and will be delivered personally, or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or sent by reputable overnight courier service, confirmed by mailing as described above at the address set forth below or to such other address as any Party may give to the other Party in writing for such purpose in accordance with this Article 16:\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nIf to Miltenyi: Miltenyi Biotec GmbH  Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 68  51429 Bergisch Gladbach  Germany  Attn: Managing Director  Fax: [...***...]\n\nWith copy to (for legal matters):  Miltenyi Biotec GmbH  Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 68  51429 Bergisch Gladbach  Germany  Attn: General Counsel  Fax: [...***...]\n\nIf to Bellicum Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Either Party may change its address by giving the other notice thereof in the manner provided herein.\n\nARTICLE 17 ASSIGNMENT\n\n17.1 This Agreement shall not be assignable, pledged or otherwise transferred, nor may any right or obligations hereunder be assigned, pledged or transferred, by either Party to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent, in the event of a financing transaction by the Party asking for consent, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by the other Party; except either Party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without the consent of the other Party to an entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business or assets of the assigning Party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by merger, acquisition or otherwise; provided that intellectual property rights that are owned or held by the acquiring entity or person to such transaction (if other than one of the Parties to this Agreement) shall not be included in the technology licensed hereunder. In addition, either Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate upon written notice to the non-assigning Party; provided, however, the assigning or transferring Party shall continue to remain liable\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nfor the performance of this Agreement by such Affiliate. Upon any such assignment, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement binding upon, or inuring to the benefit of, the assigning Party shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, its assignee, whether so expressed in the assignment or not. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit Miltenyi or any of its Affiliates from granting a security interest in this Agreement and any rights hereunder to any Third Party in connection with any financing transaction to the extent provided under (and subject to the restrictions on the rights of secured parties contained in) Applicable Laws. In addition, Miltenyi or any Affiliate of Miltenyi shall have the right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any accounts and payment intangibles in connection with any financing transaction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Party, its successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Article 17 shall be null and void.\n\nARTICLE 18 FORCE MAJEURE\n\n18.1 Neither Party will be liable to the other Party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the reasonable control and without negligence of the Parties (\"Force Majeure Event\"). Such events, occurrences, or causes will include acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts of war, riots, civil commotion, terrorist acts, epidemic, failure or default of public utilities or common carriers, destruction of facilities or materials by fire, explosion, earthquake, storm or the like catastrophe, and failure of plant or machinery (provided that such failure could not have been prevented by the exercise of skill, diligence and prudence that would be reasonably and ordinarily expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances), but the inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.\n\n18.2 The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall inform promptly the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event's occurrence, anticipated duration and cessation. The Party giving such notice shall thereupon be excused from such of its obligations hereunder as it is thereby disabled from performing for so long as it is so disabled, provided, however, that such affected Party commences and continues to take reasonable and diligent actions to cure such cause.\n\nARTICLE 19 APPLICABLE LAWS; JURISDICTION\n\n19.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any Intellectual Property Right will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the jurisdiction in which such Intellectual Property Right applies.\n\n19.2 Dispute Resolution Procedures. Should any dispute, claim or controversy arise between the Parties relating to the validity, interpretation, existence, performance, termination or breach of this Agreement (collectively, a \"Dispute\"), the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations, first between their respective representatives directly involved in that Dispute and the Alliance Managers for a period of thirty (30) days, and then, if necessary, between vice presidents of the Parties for an additional fifteen (15) days, and then, if necessary, between Chief Executive Officers of the Parties for an additional five (5) Business Days. Any such Dispute not satisfactorily settled by negotiation in accordance with the foregoing process, either Party may submit such Dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (a) below; provided that nothing in this Section 19.2 will preclude either Party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section (a) below.\n\n(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue. Each Party hereto agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be brought\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nin the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the State of New York Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in such a court shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.\n\n(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n19.3 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to other remedies, immediately seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief (including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief) prohibiting the breach or threatened breach or compelling specific performance, without the necessity of proving actual damages. Such right to injunctive relief as provided for in this paragraph is in addition to, and is not in limitation of, whatever remedies either Party may be entitled to as a matter of law or equity, including money damages. The Parties agree to waive the requirement of posting a bond in connection with a court's issuance of an injunction.\n\nARTICLE 20 MISCELLANEOUS\n\n20.1 Governing Further Actions. Each Party will execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement.\n\n20.2 Independent Contractors. The relationship between Miltenyi and Bellicum created by this Agreement is one of independent contractors. Neither Party shall have the power or authority to bind or obligate the other Party, or purport to take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone, on behalf of the other Party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.\n\n20.3 Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference, and as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof) and any Quality Agreement(s) sets forth all of the covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions and understandings between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and constitutes and contains the complete, final, and exclusive understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and cancels, supersedes and terminates all prior agreements and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations conditions or understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties other than as set forth herein or in a Quality Agreement. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto) shall be binding upon the Parties hereto unless reduced to writing and signed by the respective authorized officers of the Parties.\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n20.4 Severability and Headings. If any term, condition or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith a substitute, valid and enforceable provision that most nearly effects the Parties' intent and the Parties agree to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision. If the Parties fail to agree on such an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Headings used in this Agreement are provided for convenience only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n20.5 No Waiver. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a Party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a Party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed as a waiver of such Party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such Party's right to take subsequent action. No exercise or enforcement by either Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such Party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such Party is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n20.6 Negotiated Terms.

For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are nor regarded as subcontractors.\n\n2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, except in the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will discover, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any compound or product directed to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party (including the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing activities performed on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing includes the screening (including via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target.\n\n2.7 Records. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Debarment. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that neither it nor any of its Affiliates or personnel has been debarred under any health care laws or regulations and that, to its knowledge, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to debarment are pending or threatened against such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel. Neither Party nor any of its Affiliates will use in any capacity, in connection with the Research Program, any person or entity who has been debarred. Each Party agrees and undertakes to promptly notify the other Party if such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel becomes debarred or proceedings have been initiated against any of them with respect to debarment, whether such debarment or initiation of proceedings occurs during or after the term of this Agreement.\n\n3.

Each Party may disclose Confidential Information of the other Party to its Representatives who are required to have the information in order for such Party to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement, provided that such Representatives are subject to legally binding non-use and non-disclosure obligations consistent with this Agreement, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such Representatives. If Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser, Recipient will provide Discloser prompt written notice of such disclosure obligation, if legally permissible, and upon request will reasonably assist Discloser in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If Discloser waives Recipient's compliance with this Agreement or fails to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed will maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Discloser.

Recipient agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Article 5 may cause irreparable injury to Discloser, entitling Discloser to seek to obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies without showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond required to be posted.\n\n5.6 Return of Confidential Information. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon written request, each Party will promptly return to the other Party, or upon written request of such other Party destroy, all materials containing such other Party's Confidential Information, provided, however, that the Recipient may retain in confidence (a) one archival copy of the Confidential Information of the Discloser in its legal files solely to permit the Recipient to determine compliance with this Agreement and (b) any portion of the Confidential Information of the Discloser which the Recipient is required by applicable law or regulation to retain. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the materials described above, the Parties will continue to be subject to the terms of this Section 5.\n\n6.

OntoChem will not incorporate any invention, discovery or other proprietary information owned by any third party into any Anixa Inventions or Deliverables without Anixa's prior written consent.\n\n6.5 Invention Disclosure and Implementation. Each Party will notify the other Party promptly in writing of each Invention made or generated by such Party. The determination of inventorship with respect to all Inventions will be made in accordance with United States patent law.

However, out of pocket expenses such as travel or communication costs shall be reimbursed. Each Party will have the sole right to file and prosecute patent applications claiming any Inventions of which such Party is the sole owner pursuant to this Agreement without the consent of the other Party, and such other Party will provide, and will cause its Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation and assistance with such filing and prosecution upon request. To the extent OntoChem is obligated by reason of mandatory provisions of the Gesetz \u00fcber Arbeitnehmererfindungen (ArbNErfG) (German law covering employee inventions) to make payments to its employees, OntoChem will be solely responsible, and indemnify Anixa, for any and all such payments to OntoChem's employees.\n\n6.6 No Implied Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant to either Party any rights under any intellectual property right of the other Party.\n\n7. Representations and Warranties.\n\n7.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that: (a) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is organized; (b) it has the requisite power and authority and the legal right to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; (c) it has taken all requisite action on its part to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder; (d) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Party and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its terms; and (e) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it do not conflict with any agreement, instrument or understanding, oral or written, to which it is a party, or to which it is bound, and it will not enter into any agreement, instrument or understanding, oral or written, that conflicts with the rights and obligations of this Agreement during the term of this Agreement.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Additional Representations and Warranties of OntoChem.

Each Party hereby covenants that: (a) all Representatives of such Party who participate in the performance of the activities contemplated by this Agreement will be subject to written obligations regarding the treatment of Confidential Information and the assignment of Inventions that are consistent with such Party's obligations under this Agreement, as of the commencement of such activities by such Representatives; and (b) such Party will comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection its performance of this Agreement.\n\n8. Indemnification and Insurance.\n\n8.1 Indemnification by Anixa. Anixa will indemnify, defend and hold harmless OntoChem, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any liability, demand, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from (a) Anixa's breach of this Agreement or (b) Anixa's negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, except with respect to any matter for which OntoChem is obligated to provide indemnification under Section 8.2.\n\n8.2 Indemnification by OntoChem. OntoChem will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Anixa, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any liability, demand, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from (a) OntoChem's breach of this Agreement or (b) OntoChem's negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, except with respect to any matter for which Anixa is obligated to provide indemnification under Section 8.1. Financial reimbursements claimed according to such indemnification shall not exceed payments received by OntoChem under this contract.\n\n8.3 Indemnification Procedure. A Party (the \"Indemnitee\") that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 8 will promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnitor\") in writing of any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification (each a \"Claim\"), and the Indemnitor will have the right to control the defense and/or settlement of such Claim, provided that the Indemnitee will have the right to participate, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choosing in the defense and/or settlement of such Claim. The Indemnitor will not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition of the applicable Claim that imposes any conditions or obligations on the Indemnitee. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable period of time after the commencement of any such Claim will not relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 8 except to the extent such failure is prejudicial to the Indemnitor's ability to defend such Claim. The Indemnitee and its Representatives, at the Indemnitor's request and expense, will provide full information and reasonable assistance to the Indemnitor and its legal representatives with respect to the applicable Claim subject to indemnification. It is understood that only a Party may claim indemnification under this Section 8 (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives), and such Party's Affiliates and their respective Representatives may not directly claim indemnification hereunder.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers, at levels consistent with industry standards based upon such Party's respective activities and indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Upon request, each Party will furnish to the other Party certificates issued by the applicable insurance company(ies) evidencing such insurance.\n\n9. Miscellaneous.\n\n9.1 Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to place them in the relationship of partners, principal and agent, employer/employee or joint venturer. Neither Party will have the power or right to bind or obligate the other Party, nor will either Party hold itself out as having such authority.\n\n9.2 Use of Name. Neither Party will use the name, logo or trademark of the other Party in any advertising, publicity or other promotional activities without such other Party's prior written consent, unless such use is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and subject to clause (b) of Section 5.4.\n\n9.3 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement by either Party will be in writing (in English) and will be delivered to the applicable Party at its respective address set forth below by personal delivery, e-mail, reputable international courier or registered or certified mail.

Any such arbitration will be conducted in English in the State of Delaware. The arbitrator may grant injunctive or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration, including administrative and arbitrator's fees, will be shared equally by the Parties. Each Party will bear the cost of its own attorneys' fees and expert witness fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage on a provisional basis, pending the selection of the arbitrator or pending the arbitrator's determination of the merits of any dispute pursuant to this Section 9.5.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any one or more provisions of this Agreement will be found to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the Parties will negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n9.7 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and any of the terms of this Agreement may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by each Party or, in the case of waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving compliance. The delay or failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be, or considered as, a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of such term or any other term of this Agreement.\n\n9.8 Assignment. Neither Party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement (or any of its rights or obligations hereunder) without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that either Party may assign this Agreement without such consent to an entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business or assets of such Party to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise. Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement in violation of this Section 9.8 will be null and void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the complete and entire understanding between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral, regarding such subject matter.\n\n9.10 Counterparts. The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, all of which together will constitute one instrument. Signatures to this Agreement delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g., portable document format (PDF)) will be deemed to be binding as original signatures.\n\n(The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank.

Such certificate must be in a form authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n6.4 Distributor is free to determine its minimum resale prices unilaterally. Distributor understands that neither Cisco nor any employee or representative of Cisco may give any special treatment (favorable or unfavorable) to Distributor as a result of Distributor's selection of minimum resale prices.

Cisco will credit Distributor's account with an amount equal to the number of units of such Product in Distributor's inventory and In Transit on the effective date of a price decrease multiplied by the difference between the net price paid and the new net price. Distributor will have [*****] from the effective date of the price change to exercise protection under this program by issuing a request for credit memo with supporting documentation to Cisco. Claims for price protection submitted more than [*****] from the effective date of a price decrease will be rejected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Product on order will receive an automatic retroactive price credit. The only inventoried Product covered under this price protection clause is Product which has been identified by Distributor to Cisco in the daily inventory reports required in sub-sub-section 17.2.2, excluding any Third-Party\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nSourced Product.

A transfer occurs when: (1) the original or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the Software to another entity, or (2) the original lessor of Cisco used hardware (including bundled Software) (\"Hardware\") tries to reassign the original lessee's right to use the Software to another lessee, or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the Hardware and Software bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the same as the lease situation as described in item 2 above.\n\nThis policy applies to all Software whether Standalone or Embedded. Standalone Software is Software which is not required to operate the Hardware upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded Software is Software which is incorporated into the Hardware and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of IOS).\n\nPolicy:\n\nCisco's policy is that Software, whether Standalone or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, of course, where Cisco's contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see Global Price List). For products where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Cisco\u200b\u2010 authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.\n\nUse of the Software will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between Cisco and the original Software licensee or by the new license between Cisco and the new user. Cisco may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy.\n\nLicense Fee:\n\nThe License Fee is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise noted on the Global Price List.\n\nIt is the obligation of the transferor to obtain Cisco's consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs.\n\nExceptions:\n\nProvided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without written approval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governing the transferability of Special License Software (Special License Software is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG Product)\n\nAffiliate: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to its Affiliate. An Affiliate is another entity where at least 50.1% of its voting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where as least 50.1% of the transferring entity's voting power is owned or controlled by the transferee.\n\nMerger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferor's business to which those licenses pertain. Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the end of the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new License Fee, provided leasing company gives Cisco prior written notice. Also, if the original lessee/customer defaults under the lease and the leasing company takes the equipment back before the end of the lease term, the leasing company may transfer the license to the another lessee for the remainder of the original lease term, without paying Cisco a License Fee, upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco, or as soon as practicable if the equipment is re-leased before such 30- day period. If the new lease term is in\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nexcess of the original lease term, the leasing company is expected to pay Cisco a new License Fee on or before the expiration date of the original lease term. [NOTE: In the situation where a leasing company leases Cisco equipment to Customer A for a specified term and at the end of the lease term, the leasing company desires to lease the same equipment to Customer B, leasing company may not transfer the license without obtaining a new license from Cisco.)].\n\nOutsource: Customer desires to outsource the operation, support and maintenance of its network to a third party (e.g. EDS) (\"Third-Party Service Provider\"), for the benefit of that customer. As part of the outsourcing, customer transfers all of its rights, title and interest to the assets, including certain Cisco products and software licenses, to the Third-Party Service Provider. Customer may transfer the license to the Third-Party Service Provider solely for the purposes of providing services to Customer upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco.\n\nAll notices should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com or as indicated in the agreement between Cisco and the customer or transferor, if any.\n\nConditions of Transfer:\n\nTransfers, in any event, shall only be allowed under the following conditions:\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer are not in breach of the agreement governing the use of the Software or any other agreement with Cisco;\n\n\u25e6 Any additional services or charges incurred by Cisco as the result of any transfer shall be borne by the transferor and transferee; and\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer shall provide written prior notice of a permitted transfer to Cisco and the transferee shall, in a writing to Cisco, (i) assume all of the obligations of the transferor, and (ii) agree that transferee's use of the Software shall be governed by the terms of the then-current license agreement between Cisco and transferor or, at Cisco's sole discretion, by the terms of Cisco's then-current standard license agreement.\n\nQuestions?\n\nAny questions or comments regarding this policy should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nEXHIBIT G\n\nCisco End of Life Policy\n\nProducts reach the end of their Product Life Cycle for a number of reasons. These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, we have set out below Cisco's end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Cisco can play in helping to migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technology.\n\nThe End of Life Policy only applies to End of Life and End of Sale announcements made in all Theaters on or after November 30, 2002 for all Cisco product lines. The Policy does not apply to product that is already subject to an End of Life and/or End of Sale announcement. The general policy guidelines are:\n\n1. As a general rule, Cisco will provide 6 months' notice of the affected product's end-of-sale date and/or the last day when the affected product can be ordered. This notice will appear on Cisco.com site (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_end_of_life.html) and we encourage you to visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Cisco's end-of-life program. Sign up to receive notification here: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/FieldNoticeTool/field-notice\n\n2. Access to Cisco's Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a period of 5 years from the end-of-sale date for hardware and operating system software issues and for a period of 3 years from the end-of-sale date for application software issues.\n\n3. Spares or replacement parts for hardware will be available for a period of 5 years from the end-of\u200b sale date. We will provide spares and replacement parts in accordance with our Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process.\n\n4. Software support will be as follows\n\na. For the first year following the end-of-sale date, we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, or patches for critical bugs reported via the TAC or Cisco.com Web site.\n\nb. After the first year and for Operating System SW -where available- we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 4 years for operating system software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\nc. After the first year and for Application SW -where available - we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 2 years for application software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\n5. You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Cisco. Please contact your Support Account Manager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.\n\n6. Below are guidelines that should be followed to ensure that you receive effective support for the affected products within your network:\n\na. For hardware or software that is not covered under a service contract, customers may add the product(s) to a current contract or purchase a new contract until 12 months after the end-of-sale date.\n\nb. Service contracts that have not been renewed or have lapsed after 12 months of end-of\u200b sale date are not re-newable.\n\nc. Renewal of your service contract will generally be available until the last year of support, but will not extend\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nbeyond the last date of support.\n\nThe end-of-life milestones and Cisco commitments are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The end-of-life process consists of a series of technical and business milestones and activities that, once completed, make a product obsolete. Once obsolete, the product is not sold, manufactured, improved, repaired, maintained, or supported.\n\nEnd-of-sale date: The last date to order the product through Cisco point-of-sale mechanisms. The product is no longer for sale.\n\nHardware: The physical product and its physical components.\n\nOperating System Software: Cisco operating system software that runs on Cisco hardware Application software: Cisco software that requires the presence of some non-Cisco operating system software.\n\nSoftware Maintenance support: The time period that Cisco may release any software maintenance releases or bug fixes to the software product. After this date, Cisco Engineering will no longer develop, repair, maintain, or test the product software.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019", "clauses": [{"start": 2581, "end": 2626, "text": "NONEXCLUSIVE VALUE ADDED DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT", "fine_label": "document name", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 427, "end": 437, "text": "Distributor", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 472, "end": 487, "text": "ScanSource, Inc.", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 630, "end": 634, "text": "Cisco", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 630, "end": 648, "text": "Cisco Systems, Inc.", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2516, "text": "January 22, 2007", "fine_label": "agreement date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 806, "end": 855, "text": "the date last written below (\"the Effective Date\")", "fine_label": "effective date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2516, "text": "January 22, 2007", "fine_label": "effective date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 35436, "end": 35635, "text": "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue thereafter for a period of two (2) years, unless extended by written agreement of both parties or sooner terminated as set forth below.", "fine_label": "expiration date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 35637, "end": 36040, "text": "Without prejudice to either party's right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in sub\u200b sections 18.2 to 18.5 below, Cisco may, by written notice to Distributor, given at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term of the Agreement, extend the term of the Agreement for the period set forth in such notice, up to a maximum of one (1) year beyond the then- current expiration date.", "fine_label": "renewal term", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 52322, "end": 52709, "text": "The validity, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law, and the state and federal courts of California shall have jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Agreement.", "fine_label": "governing law", "broad_label": "Metadata"}]}

In such events, all royalties on sales theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            20. No Joint Venture.\n\n            Nothing herein contained shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of partners or joint venturers, and Diplomat shall have no power to obligate or bind KI, Inc. in any manner whatsoever.\n\n            21. No Assignment or Sublicense by Diplomat.\n\n            This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are personal to Diplomat and shall not, without the written consent of KI, Inc., be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise encumbered by Diplomat or by operation of law.\n\n                                       11\n\n            KI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.\n\n            22.

Additional Endorsers. If, during the term of this Agreement, Diplomat should utilize the services of any other person to endorse its products, and the public image of such person is so inconsistent with that of KI as to risk damaging the good will of KI's name should KI, Inc. continue to do business with Diplomat, then KI, Inc. shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, subject to the remedial and other provisions of paragraph 14 of this Agreement.\n\n            24.

Consistent with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC shall compare the cost model formula results between the invoiced pricing for Products [*] and the actual cost data that applied to the formula for the period. [*] Additionally, IAC and Sonos may agree to settle other costs that are incurred [*] in the next PPV calculation. Based on the results of the PPV calculation, the Parties will execute a credit or debit (positive or negative) memo for the entire Purchase Price Variance amount to be applied against the next payment(s) made by Sonos. IAC agrees to provide Sonos with any requested documentation relevant to the PPV calculation, including but not limited to copies of invoices from Components suppliers.\n\n7.9. Component Procurement, Supply Management, Component Buffer Inventory, and Excess Components. Sonos desires to empower IAC to place Component purchase orders and otherwise manage the Component supply chain necessary to execute the on-time manufacture and shipment of Products. IAC shall be responsible to maintain accurate and up to date Component Lead Times and cancellation terms for all Components required to manufacture Products, and to place purchase orders for all Components according to Component Lead Times and the most recent Sonos Purchase Orders and Rolling Forecast. For Components that more than one supplier is qualified for usage in Products (\"multi-sourced Components\"), IAC shall execute Component purchase orders according to the volume share instruction given by Sonos. For such multi-sourced Components, IAC and Sonos shall agree to a process to, on [*], review and revise according to Sonos' instruction the purchase order volume share to be placed by IAC between qualified Component suppliers. In the event of a change in quantities of Products in a Sonos Purchase Order or Rolling Forecast, IAC shall respond quickly to adjust its purchase orders for all Components and to confirm revised supply plans with all Component suppliers. Within [*] of receiving a new Sonos Rolling Forecast, IAC shall review Product manufacturing capacity and Component availability and provide Sonos a written shipment commitment plan (including shipment quantities by date). This plan should meet Sonos' latest Rolling Forecast unless Product manufacturing capacity or Component availability does not support the Rolling Forecast, in which case the Parties will work together to resolve such issues. Unless Sonos otherwise instructs IAC in writing, IAC shall not reduce or cancel purchase orders on any other Components due to such Component shortage. In the event that IAC notifies Sonos that it is in possession of Excess Components, (and subject to the maximum liability parameters set forth in Exhibit C), IAC will use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce its inventory of Excess Components, including, without limitation, returning such Excess Components to the supplier, using such Components for IAC's support and repair obligations, selling the Excess Components (subject to the limitations in this section) and/or using the Excess Components for other Products or the products of other customers of IAC or an IAC Affiliate. [*]. If IAC can only sell an Excess Component at a loss, it must obtain prior written authorization from Sonos for such sale, Page 16 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\nunless the aggregate amount of the loss Sonos would incur is [*]. Unless otherwise instructed by Sonos in writing, IAC is not authorized at any time to sell Custom Components to any third party or IAC Affiliate. [*], IAC shall send to Sonos a written report detailing any remaining Excess Components. If requested by Sonos, IAC agrees to provide all documentation (purchase order date, quantity ordered, Component lead-time, etc.) supporting IAC's determination that the inventory is considered Excess Components. [*]. In the event Sonos instructs IAC to scrap any Components, IAC shall notify Sonos at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of scrapping the Components and Sonos reserves the right to witness such scrap.\n\n7.9.1. Component Buffer Inventory. IAC agrees to maintain [*] of buffer inventory for Components to support possible short lead time increases in Product quantities. The [*] of Component inventory is IAC's responsibility to manage, and can be achieved through any one of the following methods: 1) [*] 2) [*] 3) [*]\n\nThe Component buffer inventory amount shall be calculated by [*]. As this [*] increases or decreases, IAC will manage the Component buffer inventory up or down as required. All Component inventories will be utilized by IAC for the manufacture of Products on a [*] basis. For Component buffer inventory stored at a Component supplier factory, Sonos and IAC shall develop a process to regularly validate that the correct levels of Component buffer inventory are in fact in place. [*]. As a Product approaches end of life, Sonos will instruct IAC in writing to reduce or eliminate all Component buffer inventories in order to minimize the risk of an Excess Component occurrence.\n\n7.9.2. Clear to Build Reporting. On a [*] basis and covering at least [*] of the then-current Sonos Rolling Forecast, IAC shall provide Sonos with a written \"Clear to Build\" report for each Product. This report shall include each Component required for that Product and incorporate each Component supplier's supply commitment to IAC. The report shall compare the supplier supply commitments to IAC's Component requirements in order to meet the current Rolling Forecast. While the detailed format of the report will be agreed between Sonos and IAC, the intent of the Clear to Build report is to proactively highlight potential Component supply shortages so that they can be resolved in advance of becoming an impact to IAC's manufacture of Products. IAC agrees, if requested by Sonos, to publish an updated Clear to Build report more frequently than [*] during periods where significant Component shortage risks are present.\n\n7.9.3. Component Discontinuance Purchase. In the event IAC or Sonos receives a manufacture discontinuance or end of life notice for a Component and the Component being discontinued does not have a replacement or substitute approved by Sonos prior to the last time buy date from the manufacturer, IAC agrees to purchase and store such discontinued Component during the term of this Agreement at a quantity specified in writing by Sonos and a Sonos PO is placed on IAC for the specified Component quantity. [*].\n\n7.10. Audit Right. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of [*] thereafter, IAC shall keep accurate and complete records of any items that are used in calculating a payment obligation of Sonos. No more than once per year during the Term, Sonos shall have the right, [*], to examine and audit IAC's books and records related to Sonos [*]. In the event such records are stored electronically Page 17 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\non a system that IAC cannot give Sonos access to, IAC will provide print-outs of the requested documents. [*]. Any such audit will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with IAC's business activities. [*]. Sonos agrees that IAC may take reasonable precautions to preserve the identity of any IAC customer that might otherwise be compromised during such an audit.\n\n8.0 NPI; FUTURE PRODUCTS\n\n8.1. New Production Introduction.

The Parties agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Titles and headings to articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

Page 34 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit F\n\nSonos Supplier Performance Review F.1 Introduction.\n\nSonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance.\n\nThe basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The Sonos Supplier Performance Review program provides a framework for effective communication between Sonos and its suppliers regarding the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to: \u2022 Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties \u2022 Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable \u2022 Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements \u2022 Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and manufacturing partners\n\nSuccessful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth. F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics.\n\nIAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution. The Parties will mutually agree in good faith upon valid performance metrics, goals, and a relevant scoring template and process.\n\nThe Parties agree to meet [*] to review IAC's performance and scoring for the period. It is targeted to alternate meeting locations between Sonos' USA HQ office and IAC's factory. Dates and locations for such reviews will be agreed between the Parties with reasonable notice.

Sonos reserves the right to audit and measure any manufacturing or test process or cycle time, as well as review any relevant IAC documentation to verify that Product pricing is calculated accurately. Consistent with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC will review all inputs to the above Pricing Formula for each Product on a quarterly basis, and adjust Product pricing as necessary to become effective in the next quarter.

SRP hereby warrants that it has the authority to grant all rights to Baker under this Article 3.\n\n      4. ASSOCIATE AND SECONDARY SPONSORSHIPS. SRP shall have the right to obtain secondary and associate sponsors for the Race Car and Team, subject to the approval of Logan's, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

From the Launch Date and ending on the last day of the next Calendar Quarter and each subsequent Calendar Quarter during the Term, Exact shall owe Pfizer a service fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the product of: Laboratory Service Revenue minus Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue (\"Incremental Laboratory Service Revenue\") for the Calendar Quarter multiplied by Gross Margin Percent for the Calendar Quarter (such product, the \"Promotion Fee\"). In no event shall the Gross Margin Percent used in the calculation of the Promotion Fee be less than sixty-eight percent (68%) or more than seventy-four percent (74%). The calculation of the Promotion Fee pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) is subject to Section 4.2(c) below. Promotion Fee(s) and all compensation paid by Exact to Pfizer under this Agreement, even where calculated as a percentage of sales, is intended to compensate Pfizer a fair market value for the entirety of services that Pfizer is providing to Exact hereunder. The formula for the calculation of the Promotion Fee is as follows: A = Laboratory Service Revenue B = Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue C = Gross Margin Percent Promotion Fee = 0.5 * (A-B) * C 31\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue. The chart below sets forth the Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue for the Product for each Calendar Year during the Term (the \"Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue\"). In the Annual Marketing Plan the appropriate Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue shall be allocated among each Calendar Quarter during such Calendar Year, taking into consideration seasonality or other sales demand variables. For 2018, the first Calendar Quarter shall be from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 and the Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue allocated to that Calendar Quarter shall be $130 million.\n\nCalendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue 2018 $441 million 2019 $622 million 2020 $861 million 2021 $1.191 billion (c) Supplemental Promotion Fee.

(ii) As of June 30 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate a partial-period amount to be paid toward the potential First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the potential Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be. With regard to the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for 2018, and the first six (6) months of Calendar Year 2019, is less than $22.5 million, and with regard to each Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for the six-month (6-month) period through June 30 is less than $15 million. (iii) As of December 31 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate the First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, for the entirety of the applicable period. Exact shall pay Pfizer the First 32\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, less any partial-period payment made by Exact during the applicable period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii).

(v) Any amounts due under Sections 4.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall be payable within thirty (30) days after each of June 30 , and December 31  of each Calendar Year, beginning with June 30, 2019, as applicable. (d) OB/Gyn Sales. If Exact (i) grants OB/Gyn Commercial Rights to a Third Party in accordance with Section 3.1(c) or (ii) launches its own sales channel in the OB/Gyn Field (as applicable, the \"Excluded Channel\"), then the Laboratory Service Revenue used to perform the calculation set forth in Section 4.2(a) and to determine royalty payments pursuant to Section 8.7 shall exclude all Laboratory Service Revenue attributable to the Excluded Channel except a mutually agreed percentage of Laboratory Service Revenue during the applicable period attributable to such Excluded Channel (the \"Included Revenue Percentage\"); provided, that (A) such Included Revenue Percentage will reflect the anticipated relative contribution of the Parties with regard to the Excluded Channel after such launch, and (B) the Included Revenue Percentage shall not be less than the revenue percentage attributable to the OB/Gyn Field as of the date of such launch, calculated on the same basis that revenue from the OB/Gyn Field is calculated by Exact on the Effective Date. 4.3 Fee Statements and Payments.

It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made under this Agreement are exclusive of any value added or similar tax (\"VAT\"), and that no such VAT shall apply to the payments made under this Agreement. In the event any payments made pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the laws or regulation of any jurisdiction, the Party making such payment shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of the payee to the extent required by Applicable Law and such amounts payable to the payee shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under Applicable Law to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, the payee. To the extent that the Party making a payment is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any payments under this Agreement, the Party making such payment shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to the payee an official tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding sufficient to enable the payee to claim such payments of taxes. The payee shall provide any tax forms to the Party making such payment that may be reasonably necessary in order for such Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. The payee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any such tax forms to the Party making the payment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for any payments for which the payee desires that the Party making the payment apply a reduced withholding rate. Each Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or VAT. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) if an action (including any assignment or sublicense of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with Applicable Law or filing or record retention requirements) by a Party leads to the imposition of withholding tax liability or VAT on the other Party that would not have been imposed in the absence of such action or in an increase in such liability above the liability that would have been imposed in the absence of such action, then the sum payable by that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the other Party 34\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nreceives a sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such action occurred, (b) otherwise, the sum payable by that Party (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be made to the other Party after deduction of the amount required to be so deducted or withheld, which deducted or withheld amount shall be remitted in accordance with Applicable Law. 4.5 No Partnership Provision. It is expressly agreed that Pfizer and Exact shall be independent contractors and that the relationship between Pfizer and Exact shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency.

Exact shall indemnify, defend and hold Pfizer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the \"Pfizer Indemnitees\") harmless from any claims, damages, actions, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred in defending against them, (hereinafter \"Claims\") of a Third Party arising out of (A) the manufacture, Marketing, education, Promotion, importation or use of the Product or the performance of the Product Laboratory Service by Exact or its Representatives; (B) any breach by Exact of any of its representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement; or (C) any negligent or wrongful act or omission of Exact; and (D) any alleged patent infringement, regardless of direct, contributory or inducement, by Pfizer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, as a result of the performance of Pfizer's obligations under this Agreement; except, in each case (A) - (D), to the extent such Claims arise out of any breach by any Pfizer Indemnitee of any of its obligations under this Agreement, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Pfizer Indemnitee. (b) Indemnification by Pfizer. Pfizer shall indemnify, defend and hold Exact, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the \"Exact Indemnitees\"), harmless from any Claims of a Third Party, to the extent arising out of (i) any breach by Pfizer of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any negligent or wrongful act or omission of Pfizer, except to the extent such Claims arise out of any breach by any Exact Indemnitee of any of its obligations under this Agreement, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Exact Indemnitee; provided that in no event shall Pfizer have any obligation to indemnify Exact for any product liability claim arising out of bodily injury or death arising from the use of the Product. (c) Procedure. (i) A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 6.1 (an \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt written notification to the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the commencement of any Claim by a Third Party for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided 44\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nin this Section 6.1(c) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under Section 6.1, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification. (ii) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith. (iii) The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. (iv) The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 6.2 Insurance Requirements. Each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term and for five (5) years after the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including products liability insurance, with minimum \"A-\" AM Best rated insurance carriers, in each case with limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate. All deductibles/retentions will be the responsibility of the named insured. Pfizer and its Affiliates will be an additional insured on Exact's commercial general liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation. To the extent of its culpability, all coverages of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.2 to the contrary, Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance. 45\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither Party's insurance will be construed to create a limit of liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Section 6. 6.3 Limitation of Liability. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT FOR (A) INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF A PARTY UNDER SECTION 6.1, (B) A BREACH OF SECTION 7 BY A PARTY OR (C) THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF A PARTY, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR PENALTIES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. CONFIDENTIALITY; PUBLICITY. 7.1 Confidentiality. Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing, the Parties agree that, for the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years thereafter, each Party (the \"Receiving Party\"), receiving any Confidential Information of the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") hereunder shall keep such Confidential Information confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose or use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement. \"Confidential Information\" means any technical, scientific, regulatory, commercial, business or other information provided by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to or disclosed during any transaction contemplated hereby (including information disclosed prior to the Effective Date under a confidentiality agreement in contemplation of this Agreement), including information relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Product, and the scientific, regulatory or business affairs or other activities of either Party; provided that, Confidential Information shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can establish: (a) was already known to the Receiving Party (other than under an obligation of confidentiality), at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party and such Receiving Party has documentary evidence to that effect; (b) was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party; (c) became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after its disclosure or development, as the case may be, and other than through any act or omission of a Party in breach of this confidentiality obligation; (d) was disclosed to that Party, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, by a Third Party who had no obligation, directly or indirectly, to the Disclosing Party, not to disclose such information to others; or 46\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) was independently discovered or developed by or on behalf of the Receiving Party without the use of the Confidential Information belonging to the other Party and the Receiving Party has documentary evidence to that effect. 7.2 Authorized Disclosure and Use. (a) Disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 7.1, each Party may disclose to Third Parties Confidential Information belonging to the other Party to the extent such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) prosecute or defend litigation, (ii) exercise or enforce rights hereunder; provided that such disclosure is covered by terms of confidentiality no less stringent than those set forth herein, and (iii) comply with inquires by a Governmental Authority or subpoena issued by a Governmental Authority or a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a Party shall deem it necessary to disclose pursuant to this Section 7.2 Confidential Information belonging to the other Party, the Disclosing Party shall to the extent possible give reasonable advance notice of such disclosure to the other Party and take reasonable measures to ensure confidential treatment of such information. (b) Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 7.1, during the Term, each Party shall have the right to use the other Party's Confidential Information in carrying out its respective responsibilities under this Agreement. 7.3 Certain Regulatory Filings. Either Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to the extent required, in the reasonable opinion of such Party's legal counsel, to comply with Applicable Laws, including the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or by any stock exchange or regulatory body to which the Party is subject. Before disclosing this Agreement or any of the terms hereof pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Parties will consult with one another regarding the terms in this Agreement to be redacted in making any such disclosure. If a Party discloses this Agreement or any of the terms hereof in accordance with this Section 7.3, such Party agrees, at its own expense, to seek confidential treatment of portions of this Agreement or such terms, as may be reasonably requested by the other Party. 7.4 Public Announcements. The Parties shall agree upon a joint press release to announce the execution of this Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 7.4.Neither Party shall issue any news release or other public announcement relating to this Agreement except as set forth in Exhibit 7.4, including any of its terms, or to the performance of either Party hereunder, without the prior written approval of the other Party; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Exact from making required disclosures or filings required by Applicable Law or by the rules 47\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nand regulations of any securities exchange.

TERM AND TERMINATION. 8.1 Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2021 and any Renewal Term (the \"Term\"), unless terminated earlier as set forth herein. 8.2 Renewal. This Agreement may be renewed for an additional one year term (\"Renewal Term\") upon mutual written agreement of the Parties. Ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of the Renewal Term, or as far in advance as practicable if the Parties agree to a Renewal Term less than ninety (90) days prior the commencement of such Renewal Term, the Parties shall agree to a Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue, Baseline M&P Expenses and Shared M&P Expenses for the Renewal Term. All other terms of this Agreement shall remain the same through the Renewal Term. 8.3 Termination for Cause. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either Party effective: (a) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the other Party fails to make the required investments pursuant to Sections 3.5 or 3.6, as applicable, or pay any amount properly due under this Agreement; provided that neither Party may terminate if the failure of the other Party to meet the investment requirements under Sections 3.5 or 3.6, as applicable, is de minimis or not material; provided, further, that any such termination shall only become effective if the allegedly breaching Party fails to remedy or cure such breach or default prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period. If, prior to the end of such thirty (30) day period, the allegedly breaching Party remedies or cures such breach or default to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; (b) upon sixty (60) days prior written notice if the other Party materially breaches its representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that any such termination shall only become effective if the allegedly breaching Party fails to remedy or cure such breach or default prior to the end of such sixty (60) day period. If, prior to the end of such sixty (60) day period, the allegedly breaching Party remedies or cures such breach or default to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; 48\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) immediately upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other Party; provided, however, that in the case of any involuntary bankruptcy proceeding such right to terminate shall only become effective if the Party consents to the involuntary bankruptcy; or (d) immediately upon notice to the other Party, if such Party (the \"Violating Party\") is convicted of violating any Applicable Law, including applicable anti-corruption laws, bribery and corruption of public officials as well as private persons and entities, in connection with its activities under this Agreement and such violation materially adversely affects the ability of either Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Violating Party shall be liable for damages or remedies as provided by law. 8.4 Termination Without Cause. After the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Effective Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon six (6) months prior written notice to the other Party. 8.5 Mutual Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent of the Parties. 8.6 Termination for Change of Control. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon six (6) months written notice following a Change of Control of Exact; provided that such notice is given within thirty (30) days of the consummation of such Change of Control. 8.7 Royalty Upon Expiration. After the expiration of the Term or termination pursuant to Section 8.4 by either Party or Section 8.6 by Exact, based on cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue achieved during the Term or up to the termination date, Exact agrees to pay Pfizer the applicable royalty payment set forth below for twelve (12) consecutive Calendar Quarters following the expiration of the Term (the \"Tail Period\"); provided, however, the Tail Period shall be reduced to the number of full Calendar Quarters completed during the Term if less than twelve (12) Calendar Quarters if either Party terminates the Agreement without cause pursuant to Section 8.4 or Exact terminates as a result of a Change of Control pursuant to Section 8.6. Such royalty payment shall be payable to Pfizer within thirty (30) days of the end of each Calendar Quarter. Royalty payments shall be determined by multiplying the Laboratory Services Revenue and the applicable royalty rate from the chart below. Cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue during the Term Applicable Royalty Rate If < $200 million 0% If > $200 million and < $400 million 1% If > $400 million and < $600 million 2% If > $600 million 3% 49\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue achieved during the Term is $500 million, the applicable royalty rate is 2%. The royalty payable by Exact to Pfizer at the end of each Calendar Quarter after the Term is 2% of Laboratory Service Revenues for the applicable Calendar Quarter. 8.8 Consequences of Termination. (a) In the event of any termination under this Agreement, (i) Pfizer shall have no obligation to invest Shared M&P Expenses pursuant to Section 3.5 as of the effective date of the termination (except as set forth below), (ii) Pfizer shall cease to make any commitments under Section 3.2(d) as of the date of notice of termination, unless Exact notifies Pfizer pursuant to Section 8.8(b) and (iii) neither Party shall have any obligation to reimburse the other Party for any expenses for activities conducted after the effective date of such termination unless such expenses were incurred prior to termination. Notwithstanding the above, Exact agrees to pay any financial commitment made by Pfizer pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and Exhibit 3.2(d) to Third Parties following the effective date of termination; provided that such amounts conform with the then-current Annual Marketing Plan, including the budget. (b) Exact shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide six (6) month notice prior to the expiry of the Term, or in the case of termination by Pfizer under Section 8.4, within the applicable notice period in advance of the effective date of such termination, that Exact intends for Pfizer to continue providing Advertising services for the Product pursuant to Section 3.2(d). Thereafter, the Parties will use good faith efforts to agree to the Advertising services that will be provided by Pfizer during the Tail Period in accordance with Section 3.2(d) and Exhibit 8.8(b). For clarity, Pfizer's obligation to provide Advertising services during the Tail Period is limited to the expiry of the Term or termination by Pfizer pursuant to Section 8.4, or termination by Exact pursuant to Section 8.3. (c) In the event Exact terminates this Agreement for cause pursuant to Section 8.3 or Pfizer terminates this Agreement without cause pursuant to Section 8.4, Exact shall not be obligated to pay Pfizer a supplemental Promotion Fee pursuant to Section 4.2(c) for the Calendar Year, or any portion of such Calendar Year in which such termination occurs. 8.9 Survival of Certain Obligations.

Any expiration or early termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the 50\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nrights of either Party against the other accrued or accruing under this Agreement before termination. 9.

The Association,  in accordance with and pursuant to its plan of conversion  adopted by the Board of Directors of the Association  (the \"Plan\"),  intends to be converted  from a  federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally-chartered  stock savings bank and will  sell all of its  issued  and  outstanding  stock to the  Company.  The Company  will  offer  and  sell its  common  stock  (the  \"Common  Stock\")  in a subscription  offering  (\"Subscription  Offering\") to (1) tax qualified employee benefit plans of the Association,  (2) depositors of the Association as of March 31, 1995 (\"Eligible Account  Holders\"),  (3) depositors of the Association as of June 30, 1996  (\"Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders\"),  (4) certain  other deposit  account  holders  and  borrower  members  of  the  Association  (\"Other Members\") and (5) to its employees,  officers and directors,  pursuant to rights to  subscribe  for shares of Common Stock (the  \"Shares\").  Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above-listed  parties, the Company may offer for sale in a public offering (the \"Public  Offering,\" and when referred to together with the Subscription  Offering,  the \"Subscription and Public Offerings\")  conducted after the Subscription  Offering, the Shares not so subscribed for or ordered in the  Subscription  Offering  to the  general  public  (all such  offerees  being referred to in the aggregate as \"Eligible Offerees\"). Shares may also be sold in the Public Offering by a selling group of  broker-dealers  organized and managed by Capital  Resources.  It is  acknowledged  that the  purchase of Shares in the Subscription  and Public  Offerings  is subject to maximum and minimum  purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company may reject in whole or in part any subscriptions received from subscribers in the Public Offering.\n\n                  The  Company  and the  Association  desire to  retain  Capital Resources to assist the Company with its sale of the Shares in the  Subscription and Public  Offerings.  By and  through  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and the Association confirm the retention of Capital Resources to assist the Company and the Association during the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  The  Company  has  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  \"Commission\")  a registration  statement on Form S-l (File No. 333-6399)  containing an offering  prospectus  relating to the  Subscription and Public  Offerings for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"),  and has filed such  amendments  thereto,  if any, and such amended  prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof (the  \"Registration  Statement\").  The prospectus,  as amended,  included in the Registration   Statement  at  the  time  it  initially  becomes  effective,   is hereinafter called the \"Offering  Prospectus\",  except that if any prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the offering  prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement at the time it initially becomes effective,  the term \"Offering  Prospectus\" shall refer to the offering prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said offering prospectus is filed with or mailed to the Commission for filing.\n\n                  In accordance  with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion  Regulations\"),  the Association has filed with the Office  of Thrift  Supervision  (the  \"OTS\")  an  Application  for  Approval  of Conversion  on Form AC (the  \"Conversion  Application\")  including  the Offering\n\n\n\n\n\nProspectus  and has filed  such  amendments  thereto,  if any,  as may have been required by the OTS. The  Conversion  Application  has been approved by the OTS. The Company has filed with the OTS its application on Form H-(e)lS (the \"Holding Company  Application\")  to acquire the  Association  under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. ss. 1467a) (\"HOLA\").\n\n                  SECTION 2. Retention of Capital Resources;  Compensation; Sale and  Delivery  of the  Shares.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their agent to advise and assist the Company and the  Association  with the  Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  On  the  basis  of  the   representations,   warranties,   and agreements herein contained,  but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Capital Resources accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Association as to matters  relating to the Conversion and the Subscription and Public Offerings. It is acknowledged by the Company and the  Association  that Capital  Resources  shall not be required to purchase any Shares and shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent  with any  applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  or orders.  If requested by the Company or the  Association,  Capital  Resources  also may assemble and manage a selling group of broker dealers which are members of the National Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc. (the \"NASD\") to  participate in the  solicitation  of purchase  orders  for  Shares  under a selected  dealers'  agreement  (\"Selected Dealers'  Agreement\").  The  obligations of Capital  Resources  pursuant to this Agreement  shall  terminate upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the  Plan  by  the  Company  or  the  Association  or  upon  termination  of the Subscription  and  Public  Offerings,  or if the  terms  of the  Conversion  are substantially  amended  so as to  materially  and  adversely  change the role of Capital  Resources,  but in no event later than 45 days after the  completion of the Subscription and Public Offerings (the \"End Date\").  All fees due to Capital Resources  but unpaid will be payable to Capital  Resources in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings are extended beyond the End Date, the Company, the\n\n                                       -2-\n\nAssociation  and Capital  Resources may mutually  agree to renew this  Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\n                  In the event  the  Company  is  unable  to sell a  minimum  of 935,000  Shares  within  the  period  herein  provided,   this  Agreement  shall terminate,  and the Company shall refund to any persons who have  subscribed for any of the Shares,  the full amount  which it may have  received  from them plus accrued  interest  as set  forth  in the  Offering  Prospectus;  and none of the parties  to this  Agreement  shall  have any  obligation  to the  other  parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this  Section 2 and in  Sections  7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  In the event the closing  does not occur,  the  Conversion  is terminated  or  otherwise  abandoned,   or  the  terms  of  the  Conversion  are substantially  amended  so as to  materially  and  adversely  change the role of Capital  Resources,  Capital  Resources  shall be reimbursed  for all reasonable legal fees and  out-of-pocket  expenses for  rendering  financial  advice to the Association  concerning the structure of the Conversion,  preparing a market and financial analysis, performing due diligence and assisting in the preparation of the Application for Conversion and the  Registration  Statement,  which shall be paid upon such termination, abandonment or amendment or within five days of such event.\n\n                  If  all  conditions  precedent  to  the  consummation  of  the Conversion,  including,  without limitation,  the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are  satisfied,  the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Shares  sold in the  Subscription  and Public  Offerings  and to release for delivery  certificates  for such  Shares  on the  Closing  Date (as  hereinafter defined)  against  payment to the Company by any means  authorized  by the Plan, provided,  however, that no certificates shall be released for such shares until the  conditions  specified in Section 7 hereof shall have been  complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of Capital Resources and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment  therefor shall be made on a date and at a time and place acceptable to the Company, the Association and Capital Resources.  The date upon which the Company shall  release or deliver the Shares sold in the  Subscription and Public Offerings,  in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the \"Closing Date.\"\n\n                  Capital Resources shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n                  (a) (i) a  marketing  fee in the  amount  of (x)  two  percent (2.0%) of the aggregate dollar amount of all Shares sold in the Subscription and Public Offerings,  excluding sales made through broker assisted  purchases or by other NASD member firms  participating  in the Subscription and Public Offerings pursuant  to  the  Selected  Dealers'  Agreement,  if  any  (for  which  Capital Resources'  compensation shall be pursuant to sub-paragraph  (ii)) and excluding shares sold to the  Association's  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan,  directors, officers or employees and any member of such person's  immediate family (defined to include children, spouse, parents, grandparents and grandchildren);\n\n                           (ii)    a management fee in the amount of one percent and one-half (1.5%) of the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold through broker assisted  purchases or through selected dealers, if any.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (b) Capital  Resources  shall be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket  expenses,  including,  but not  limited to,  legal fees,  travel, communications  and  postage,  incurred by it whether or not the  Conversion  is successfully completed as set forth in Section 7 hereof.

Capital Resources' fees are limited to those stated in subparagraph (a) above and all other  brokers  will be paid fees based upon the  capacity  in which they are acting in the particular stock sale.\n\n                  All subscription  funds received by Capital  Resources (and if by check  shall be made  payable to the  Company)  or by other  NASD  registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S.  Mail  or  similar  type  of  transmittal)  to the  Company  by noon of the following business day.\n\n                  SECTION  3.  Offering  Prospectus;   Subscription  and  Public Offerings. The Shares are to be initially offered in the Subscription and Public Offerings at the  Purchase  Price as set forth on the cover page of the Offering Prospectus.\n\n                  SECTION 4.

The  activities of the  Association as described  in the  Offering  Prospectus,  insofar  as they are  material  to the operations  and  financial  condition of the  Association,  are permitted by the rules,  regulations and resolutions and practices of the OTS or the FDIC and any other federal or state authorities.\n\n                  (iv)  The  Association  is a  member  of the  FHLBNY,  and the deposit  accounts of the  Association  are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount  allowed  under  law  and to the  best  of such  counsel's  knowledge  no proceedings  for the  termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or threatened;  and the description of the liquidation  account as set forth in the Registration  Statement  and the  Offering  Prospectus  under the  caption  \"The Conversion - Effects of Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors  and Borrowers of the  Bank -  Liquidation  Account\"  has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and is accurate in all material respects.\n\n                  (v)  Upon  consummation  of the  Conversion,  the  authorized, issued and outstanding  capital stock of the Company will be as set forth in the Registration   Statement   and  the  Offering   Prospectus   under  the  caption \"Capitalization,\"  and no shares of Common  Stock have been issued  prior to the Closing Date; at the time of the Conversion,  the Shares subscribed for pursuant to the Offerings will have been duly and validly  authorized  for issuance,  and when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Plan against payment of\n\n\n\n\n\nthe consideration  calculated as set forth in the Plan, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable;  and the issuance of the Shares is not subject to preemptive rights.\n\n                  (vi)  The  issuance  and  sale  of  the  common  stock  of the Association  to the  Company  have  been  duly  and  validly  authorized  by all necessary  corporate  action on the part of the Company and the Association and, upon payment  therefor in accordance  with the terms of the Plan of  Conversion, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will be owned of  record  by the  Company,  free and  clear  of any  mortgage,  pledge,  lien, encumbrance or claim (legal or equitable).\n\n                  (vii) The  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized  by  all  necessary  action  on  the  part  of the  Company  and  the Association; and this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the  Association,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms (except as the enforceability  thereof may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium, reorganization  or similar laws  relating to or  affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights generally or the rights of creditors of savings  associations or savings and loan holding  companies,  the accounts of whose  subsidiaries are insured by the FDIC or by general equity principles,  regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the  extent,  if any,  that the  provisions  of  Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy).\n\n                  (viii) The Plan has been duly adopted by the required  vote of the Directors of the Company and the Association and members of the Association.\n\n                                      -16-\n\n                  (ix)  Subject to the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  to the OTS's approval of the  Conversion  and the Company's  application to acquire the Association, no further approval, registration,  authorization, consent or other order of any regulatory  agency,  public board or body is required in connection with the  execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  the issuance of the Shares and the  consummation  of the  Conversion,  except as may be required  under the regulations of the NASD and the NASDAQ National Market.

The OTS has issued its order of  approval  under the savings and loan holding company provisions of the HOLA, and the purchase by the Company of all of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of the  Association has been  authorized  by the OTS and no action has been taken,  or to  counsel's knowledge  is  pending  or  threatened,  to  revoke  any such  authorization  or approval.\n\n                  (xi) The  Registration  Statement is effective  under the 1933 Act and no stop order  suspending  the  effectiveness  has been issued under the 1933  Act  or  proceedings   therefor  initiated  or,  to  counsel's  knowledge, threatened by the Commission.\n\n                  (xii) At the time the  Conversion  Application,  including the Offering Prospectus contained therein, was approved,  the Conversion Application including the Offering Prospectus contained therein (as amended or supplemented, if so amended or supplemented) complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements  of all  applicable  federal laws and the rules,  regulations, decisions  and orders of the OTS (except as to the financial  statements,  other financial data and stock valuation information included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion); to the best of such counsel's knowledge, based on  conferences  with  management  of and the  independent  accountants  for the Company and the Association,  and on such investigation of the corporate records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the  Registration  Statement and the Conversion  Application, all material  documents  and exhibits  required to be filed with the  Conversion Application (as amended or  supplemented,  if so amended or  supplemented)  have been so filed.  The  description in the Conversion  Application and the Offering Prospectus  contained  therein of such documents and exhibits is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents the information required to be shown.\n\n                  (xiii)  At the time  that the  Registration  Statement  became effective,  (i) the  Registration  Statement (as amended or  supplemented  if so amended  or  supplemented)  (other  than  the  financial  statements  and  other financial and statistical data and stock valuation information included therein, as to which no opinion  need be  rendered),  complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and (ii) the Offering  Prospectus  (other than the  financial  statements  and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock  valuation  information  included therein,  as to which no opinion  need be  rendered)  complied as to form in all material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  1933  Act,  the  1933  Act Regulations,  Conversion Regulations and Federal and State law (other than state blue sky law as to which we express no opinion).  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge based on the conferences and document review  specified in item (xiii) above,  all  material  documents  and  exhibits  required  to be filed  with the Registration   Statement  (as  amended  or   supplemented,   if  so  amended  or supplemented) have been so filed. The description in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus  of such  documents and exhibits is accurate in all\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterial respects and fairly\n\n                                      -17-\n\npresents the  information  required to be shown.  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain  regulatory or judicial review of the final action of the OTS approving the Conversion Application or in approving the Holding Company Application.\n\n                  (xiv) During the course of such  counsel's  representation  of the Company and the  Association,  nothing has come to such counsel's  attention that  caused it to believe  that (i) the Company  and the  Association  have not conducted the  Conversion,  in all material  respects,  in  accordance  with all applicable  requirements  of the Plan and applicable law, and (ii) the Plan, the Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus (other than the financial  statements and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock valuation information included therein as to which no opinion need be rendered) do not comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  laws, rules,  regulations,  decisions  and orders  including,  but not limited to, the Conversion Regulations,  the HOLA, the 1933 Act and 1933 Act Regulations and all other  applicable  laws,  regulations,   decisions  and  orders,  including  all applicable  terms,  conditions,  requirements  and  provisions  precedent to the Conversion imposed upon it by the OTS, the Commission and the FDIC, if any.\n\n                  (xv) The  terms  and  provisions  of the  Common  Stock of the Company  conform  to the  description  thereof  contained  in  the  Registration Statement  and the Offering  Prospectus,  and the form of  certificates  used to evidence the Shares are in due and proper form.\n\n                  (xvi) To the best  knowledge  of such  counsel,  there  are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  other than those disclosed therein,  and all pending legal and governmental  proceedings to which  the  Company  or the  Association  is a party  or of  which  any of their property is the subject  which are not described in the  Registration  Statement and the Offering Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, are, considered in the aggregate, not material;  provided that for this purpose, any litigation or governmental  proceeding is not considered to be \"threatened\"  unless  the  potential  litigant  or  governmental  authority  has manifested  to the  management  of the  Company or the  Association,  or to such counsel, a present intention to initiate such litigation or proceeding.\n\n                  (xvii) To the best knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have  obtained all  licenses,  permits and other  governmental authorizations  required for the conduct of their respective businesses,  except where the failure to have such  licenses,  permits or  authorizations  would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or income or business prospects of the Company and the Association, and all such licenses, permits and other governmental  authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Company and the Association are in all material respects complying therewith.\n\n                  (xviii)   Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Association  is  in contravention of its certificate of incorporation or its charter,  respectively, or its bylaws (and the Association  will not be in  contravention of its charter or bylaws in stock form upon  consummation  of the  Conversion)  or, to the best knowledge  of such  counsel,  in  contravention  of any  obligation,  agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material contract,  indenture,  mortgage, loan  agreement,  note,  lease or other  instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its property may be bound which  contravention  would be material to the business of the Company and the  Association  considered as one  enterprise; the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Association, the incurring of the  obligations  herein set forth and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all necessary\n\n                                      -18-\n\ncorporate action of the Company and the Association,  and, to the best knowledge of such counsel,  will not constitute a material breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or the Association which are material to their  business  considered  as one  enterprise,  pursuant  to any  contract, indenture,  mortgage,  loan agreement,  note, lease or other instrument to which the Company or the  Association is a party or by which any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or the  Association  is subject.  In addition,  such action will not result in any  contravention of the provisions of the certificate of  incorporation  or bylaws of the Company or the Association  or any  applicable  law,  act,  regulation or order or court order, writ,  injunction or decree.  The charter of the  Association  in stock form has been approved by the OTS.\n\n                  (xix) To the best  knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have good and  marketable  title to all  properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement as owned by them, free and clear of all liens,  charges,  encumbrances or restrictions,  except such as are described in the  Registration  Statement  or are not material in relation to the business of the Company and the Association considered as one enterprise; and to the best of such  counsel's  knowledge,  all of the leases  and  subleases  material  to the business  of the  Company  and the  Association  under which the Company and the\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation hold properties,  as described in the Registration Statement, are in full force and effect.\n\n                  (xx) The Company and the  Association  are not in violation of any directive from the OTS or the FDIC to make any material change in the method of conducting  their business and the Company and the Association have conducted and are conducting their business so as to comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  statutes  and  regulations   (including,   without  limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders of the OTS and the FDIC).\n\n                  (xxi)  The  information  in  the  Registration  Statement  and Offering Prospectus under the captions  \"Regulation,\"  \"Certain  Restrictions on Acquisitions of the Company,\" \"The  Conversion,\"  \"Description of Capital Stock\" and the  information  in response to Items 7(d)(l),  7(f),  7(g) and 7(i) of the Form PS of the Conversion Regulations, to the extent that it constitutes matters of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,  documents  or  proceedings,  or  legal conclusions,  has been  reviewed by such  counsel and is correct in all material respects  (except  as to the  financial  statements  and  other  financial  data included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion).\n\n                  In  rendering  such  opinion,  such counsel may rely (A) as to matters  involving the  application of laws of any  jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  to the extent such counsel  deems proper and  specified in such opinion satisfactory to Capital Resources,  upon the opinion of other counsel of good  standing  (providing  that such counsel  states that Capital  Resources is justified in relying upon such  specified  opinion or  opinions),  and (B) as to matters of fact,  to the extent such counsel deems proper,  on  certificates  of responsible  officers of the Company and the  Association  and public  officials (but not on  conclusions  of law which  may be set forth in said  certificates); provided copies of any such opinion(s) or  certificates  are delivered  pursuant hereto  or to  Capital  Resources  together  with  the  opinion  to be  rendered hereunder by special  counsel to the Company and the  Association.  Such counsel may assume that any agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company or the Association.\n\n                  (2) The  letter  of  Malizia,  Spidi,  Sloane &  Fisch,  P.C., counsel for the  Company and the  Association  addressed  to Capital  Resources, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance to the effect that:\n\n                                      -19-\n\n                  During the  preparation  of the  Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus, such counsel participated in conferences with management of, and the independent  public  accountants for the Company  and the  Association.  Based  upon  such  conferences  and a review  of corporate  records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the Registration  Statement and Conversion Application, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the  Conversion  Application,  the  Registration  Statement,  the  Offering Prospectus,  or any  amendment or supplement  thereto  (other than the financial statements  and  other  financial  and  statistical  data  and  stock  valuation information  included  therein,  as to which such counsel need express no view), contained an untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\n                  (3) The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date, of Serchuk &  Zelermyer,  LLP,  Capital  Resources'  counsel,  with respect to such matters as Capital Resources may reasonably require.  Such opinion may rely upon the opinions of counsel to the Company and the Association, and as to matters of fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and  directors  of the  Company and the Association  delivered  pursuant  hereto  or as such  counsel  shall  reasonably request.\n\n                  (d) At the Closing Date,  counsel to Capital  Resources  shall have been  furnished  with such  documents  and opinions as they may  reasonably require  for the  purpose  of  enabling  them to render  the  opinion  as herein contemplated  and related  proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties,  or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.\n\n                  (e) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a certificate of the Chief Executive  Officer and the Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company and of the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Association,  dated as of such Closing Date,  to the effect that:  (i) they have carefully  examined the Offering  Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the time the  Offering  Prospectus  became  authorized  for final use,  the Offering Prospectus  did not contain an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made,  not  misleading;  (ii) since the date the Offering Prospectus became authorized for final use, in their opinion no event has  occurred  which should have been set forth in an amendment or  supplement  to the  Offering  Prospectus  which  has not been so set  forth, including specifically,  but without limitation,  any material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties, business  prospects or business affairs of the Company or the  Association,  and the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied;  (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus,  there has been no material  adverse change in the condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or in the earnings,  capital,  properties, business  affairs or  business  prospects  of the  Company  or the  Association,\n\n\n\n\n\nindependently,  or  of  the  Company  and  the  Association  considered  as  one enterprise,  whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business;  (iv) to the best  knowledge  of such  officers the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  4 are true  and  correct  with the same  force  and  effect  as  though expressly  made  at and  as of  the  Closing  Date;  (v)  the  Company  and  the Association  have complied with all material  agreements and  satisfied,  in all material  respects at or prior to the Closing Date, all obligations  required to be met by  such  date  and  will  in  all  material  respects  comply  with  all obligations  to be  satisfied  by them  after  Conversion;  (vi)  no stop  order suspending the  effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement has been initiated or, to the best  knowledge  of the  Company or  Association,  threatened  by the Commission or any state authority; (vii) no order suspending the Subscription or Public Offerings, the Conversion, the\n\n                                      -20-\n\nacquisition  of all of the  shares  of the  Association  by the  Company  or the effectiveness  of the  Offering  Prospectus  has  been  issued  and to the  best knowledge of the Company or  Association,  no proceedings  for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the OTS, the Commission,  the FDIC, or any state authority;  and (viii) to the best of their  knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain review of the final action of the OTS approving the Plan.\n\n                  (f) Prior to and at the Closing  Date:  (i) in the  reasonable opinion of Capital  Resources,  there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings,  or the business affairs or business  prospects of the Company or the Association  independently, or of the Company or the  Association,  considered as one enterprise,  since the latest dates as of which such condition is set forth in the Offering Prospectus, except  as  referred  to  therein;  (ii)  there  shall  have  been  no  material transaction  entered into by the Company or the Association from the latest date as of which the  financial  condition of the Company or the  Association  is set forth  in  the  Offering  Prospectus  other  than  transactions  referred  to or contemplated  therein;  (iii)  the  Company  or the  Association  shall not have received  from the OTS or the FDIC any  direction  (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their business with which it has not complied  (which  direction,  if any,  shall  have  been  disclosed  to  Capital Resources) and which would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the  business,  operations  or  financial  condition  or income of the Company or the  Association  taken as a whole;  (iv) neither the Company nor the Association  shall have been in default (nor shall an event have occurred which, with  notice or lapse of time or both,  would  constitute  a default)  under any provision of and  agreement or instrument  relating to any material  outstanding indebtedness;  (v) no action, suit or proceedings, at law or in equity or before or by any federal or state  commission,  board or other  administrative  agency, shall be  pending,  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association, threatened  against the Company or the  Association  or  affecting  any of their properties wherein an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse  effect on the business,  operations, financial  condition  or income of the  Company or the  Association,  taken as a whole;  and (vi) the Shares have been  qualified or registered  for offering and sale  under the  securities  or blue sky laws of the  jurisdictions  as  Capital Resources shall have requested and as agreed to by the Company.\n\n                  (g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Capital Resources shall receive a letter from KPMG,  dated the date hereof and addressed to Capital  Resources:  (i) confirming that KPMG is a firm of independent public accountants  within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and 12 C.F.R. ss. 571.2(c)(3) and no information concerning its relationship with or interests in the Company and the  Association is required to be disclosed in the Offering Prospectus by the Conversion Regulations or Item 10 of the Registration Statement, and stating in effect that in KPMG's opinion the financial statements of the Association as are included in the Offering  Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the related published rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and the Conversion  Regulations and generally  accepted  accounting  principles; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not  an  audit  examination  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing standards)  consisting of a reading of the latest  available  unaudited  interim financial statements of the Association  prepared by the Association,  a reading of the  minutes of the  meetings  of the Board of  Directors  and members of the Association and consultations  with officers of the Association  responsible for financial and accounting  matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to  believe  that:  (A)  such  unaudited  financial  statements  are not in conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a basis substantially  consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Offering Prospectus; or (B) during the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the\n\n                                      -21-\n\nOffering  Prospectus to a specified  date not more than five business days prior to the date hereof,  there has been (1) an increase of greater than  $500,000 in the long term debt of the  Association or (2) an increase of $100,000 or more in loans past due 90 days or more as of the last day of the month immediately prior to such  specified  date or (3) an  increase  of $100,000 or more in real estate acquired by  foreclosure  or (4) a decrease of $50,000 or more in the  allowance for loan losses or (5) any decrease in total retained earnings or (6) a decrease\n\n\n\n\n\nin net  income  when  compared  to the like  period in 1995 or (7) any change in total assets of the Association in an amount greater than  $2,000,000  excluding proceeds  from stock  subscriptions;  and (iii) stating that, in addition to the audit examination referred to in its opinion included in the Offering Prospectus and  the  performance  of the  procedures  referred  to in  clause  (ii) of this subsection  (g), they have compared with the general  accounting  records of the Company and/or the Association, as applicable, which are subject to the internal controls of the Company and/or the Association, as applicable, accounting system and other data prepared by the Company  and/or the  Association,  as applicable, directly from such accounting  records,  to the extent specified in such letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Offering  Prospectus as Capital Resources  may  reasonably  request;  and  they  have  found  such  amounts  and percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).\n\n                  (h) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a letter  from KPMG,  dated the  Closing  Date,  addressed  to Capital  Resources, confirming  the  statements  made by its  letter  delivered  by it  pursuant  to subsection (g) of this Section 8, except that the  \"specified  date\" referred to in clause (ii)(B) thereof to be a date specified in such letter, which shall not be more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.\n\n                  (i) The Company and the  Association  shall not have sustained since  the date of the  latest  audited  financial  statements  included  in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion,  flood or other calamity,  whether or not covered by insurance,  or from any labor dispute or court or governmental  action, order or  decree,  otherwise  than as set forth or  contemplated  in the  Registration Statement and Offering  Prospectus,  and since the respective  dates as of which information  is given in the  Registration  Statement  and Offering  Prospectus, there  shall  not have  been any  material  change  in the long term debt of the Company or the Association  other than debt incurred in relation to the purchase of Shares by the Company's  Tax-Qualified  Employee Plans, or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company or the  Association,  otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement and Offering Prospectus,  the effect of which, in any such  case  described  above,  is  in  Capital  Resources'  reasonable  judgment sufficiently  material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the  Subscription or Public Offerings or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Offering Prospectus.\n\n                  (j) At or prior to the Closing Date,  Capital  Resources shall receive  (i) a copy  of the  letter  from  the  OTS  authorizing  the use of the Offering Prospectus,  (ii) a copy of the order from the Commission declaring the Registration  Statement  effective,  (iii) a copy of a certificate  from the OTS evidencing  the good  standing of the  Association,  (iv)  certificates  of good standing from the States of Delaware and New York  evidencing  the good standing of the  Company  and from the State of New York  evidencing  that the Company is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in New York and (v) a copy of the letter from the OTS approving the Company's Holding Company Application.\n\n                  (k)      As soon as available after the Closing Date, Capital Resources shall receive a\n\n                                      -22-\n\ncertified copy of the Association's stock charter.\n\n                  (1)  Subsequent  to the  date  hereof,  there  shall  not have occurred any of the  following:  (i) a suspension  or  limitation  in trading in securities  generally on the New York Stock  Exchange or American Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter  market, or quotations halted generally on the NASDAQ National  Market,  or minimum or maximum  prices for  trading  being  fixed,  or maximum  ranges for  prices  for  securities  being  required  by either of such exchanges or the NASD or by order of the  Commission  or any other  governmental authority;  (ii) a general  moratorium on the operations of commercial  banks or federal  savings banks or general  moratorium on the withdrawal of deposits from commercial  banks or federal  savings banks  declared by either federal or state authorities; (iii) the engagement by the United States in hostilities which have resulted  in the  declaration,  on or  after  the  date  hereof,  of a  national emergency  or war;  or (iv) a  material  decline  in the price of equity or debt securities  if, as to clauses (iii) or (iv),  the effect of such  hostilities or decline, in Capital Resources'  reasonable  judgment,  makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Subscription or Public Offerings or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner  contemplated  in the  Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus.\n\n                  All such opinions, certifications, letters and documents shall be in compliance with the provisions  hereof only if they are, in the reasonable opinion of Capital Resources and its counsel,  satisfactory to Capital Resources and its  counsel.  Any  certificates  signed by an  officer or  director  of the Company or the  Association  and  delivered to Capital  Resources or its counsel shall be deemed a representation  and warranty by the Company or the Association to Capital Resources as to the statements made therein.\n\n                  If any of the  conditions  specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  this Agreement and all of Capital  Resources'  obligations  hereunder  may be  canceled  by Capital Resources by notifying the  Association  of such  cancellation  in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such  cancellation shall be without  liability  of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the above, if this\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement  is  canceled  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,   the  Company  and  the Association  jointly and severally agree to reimburse  Capital Resources for all out-of-pocket  expenses,  (including without limitation the fees and expenses of Capital Resources' counsel) reasonably incurred by Capital Resources and Capital Resources'  counsel at its normal rates,  in connection  with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  and in contemplation of the proposed  Subscription  or Public  Offerings  to the extent  provided for in Sections 2 and 7 hereof.\n\n                  SECTION 9.  Indemnification.\n\n                  (a) The Company  and the  Association  jointly  and  severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and  employees  and each person,  if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital  Resources within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act,  against any and all loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several,  that Capital  Resources or any of them may suffer or to which Capital  Resources  and any such persons  upon  written  demand for any expenses (including fees and  disbursements of counsel)  incurred by Capital Resources or any of them  in  connection  with  investigating,  preparing  or  defending  any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or actions (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material\n\n                                      -23-\n\nfact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary  or  final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or supplement thereto),  the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky application or other  instrument  or document of the Company or the  Association  or based upon written  information  supplied  by the Company or the  Association  filed in any state or  jurisdiction  to  register  or qualify any or all of the Shares or the subscription  rights  applicable  thereto  under  the  securities  laws  thereof (collectively,  the  \"Blue  Sky  Application\"),  or  any  application  or  other document,  advertisement, oral statement, or communication (\"Sales Information\") prepared,  made or executed  by or on behalf of the Company  with its consent or based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Association, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify or register the Shares under the securities  laws thereof;  (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents  or  information,  a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which  they were  made,  not  misleading;  or,  (iii)  arise  from any theory of liability  whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,   any  Blue  Sky   Application   or  Sales   Information  or  other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion;  provided, however, that no  indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims,  damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue  material  statements or alleged  untrue  material  statements in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion  Application,  any Blue Sky Application,  the preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement  thereto),  or Sales  Information  made in  reliance  upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company or the Association by Capital Resources  regarding  Capital  Resources  expressly for use under the caption \"The Conversion - Marketing Arrangements\" in the Offering Prospectus nor is  indemnification  required for material  oral  misstatements  made by Capital Resources,  which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the  Company  orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary or final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  the Conversion   Application,   any  Blue  Sky  Application  or  Sales   Information distributed in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (b) Capital  Resources  agrees to indemnify  and hold harmless the Company and the Association,  their directors and officers, agents, servants and  employees  and  each  person,  if any,  who  controls  the  Company  or the Association within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act  against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage or  expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses),  joint or several which they,  or any of them,  may suffer or to which they,  or any of them,  may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly  reimburse  the  Company,  the  Association  and any such  persons upon written demand for any expenses  (including fees and  disbursements  of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment of supplement thereto),  or the preliminary or final Offering  Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that Capital Resources  obligations  under this  Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the\n\n                                      -24-\n\n\n\n\n\nextent that such untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged  material fact was omitted from, the  Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the  preliminary  or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion Application,  any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to  the  Company  or  the Association by Capital Resources  regarding Capital Resources  expressly for use under the caption  \"The  Conversion  - Marketing  Arrangements\"  in the Offering Prospectus  or in the event of oral  misstatements  made by  Capital  Resources, which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the Company orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the  Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,  any  Blue Sky  Application  or Sales  Information  distributed  in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action,  proceeding,  claim (whether commenced or threatened),  or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder,  but  failure to so notify an  indemnifying  party  shall not relieve it from any liability  which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise.  An  indemnifying  party may  participate  at its own  expense in the defense of such action.  In addition,  if it so elects within a reasonable  time after  receipt of such notice,  an  indemnifying  party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties  receiving such notice,  may assume defense of such action with  counsel  chosen by it and  approved by the  indemnified  parties  that are defendants in such action,  unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those  available to such  indemnifying party.  If an  indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the indemnifying  parties  shall not be liable for any fees and  expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim,  other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm of  attorneys  (and any special  counsel  that said firm may retain)  for  all  indemnified  parties  in  connection  with  any  one  action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,  proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction  arising out of the same general  allegations or circumstances.\n\n                  (d) The agreements  contained in this Section 9 and in Section 10  hereof  and  the  representations  and  warranties  of the  Company  and the Association set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital Resources or its officers, directors or controlling persons, agents or employees or by or on behalf of the Company or the Association or any officers,  directors or controlling persons, agents or employees of the Company or the Association or any controlling  person,  director or officer of the Company or the Association; (ii) delivery of and payment  hereunder for the Shares; or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.\n\n                  (e) No  indemnification  by the Association under Section 9(a) hereof nor  contribution  under Section 10 hereof shall be effective if the same shall be deemed to be in violation of any law, rule or regulation  applicable to the  Association  including,  without  limitation,  Section  23A of the  Federal Reserve Act. If the  indemnification  or  contribution by the Association is not effective  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence,  then the  indemnification  by Capital  Resources  pursuant to Section 9(b) shall be given only to the Company, its  directors  and  officers,  agents,  servants and  employees  and not to the Association,  its directors and officers, agents, servants and employees and the Association  shall not be entitled to any  contribution  from Capital  Resources pursuant to Section 10.\n\n                                      -25-\n\n                  SECTION  10.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and equitable  contribution in circumstances in which the  indemnification  provided for in  Section 9 is due in  accordance  with its  terms  but is for any  reason unavailable  as a result of  Section  9(e) or held by a court to be  unavailable from the  Company,  the  Association  or Capital  Resources,  the  Company,  the Association  and Capital  Resources  shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses, claims,  damages and liabilities  (including any investigation,  legal and other expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of any action,  suit or  proceeding  of any claims  asserted,  but after  deducting any contribution  received by the Company or the  Association  or Capital  Resources from  persons  other than the other  party  thereto,  who may also be liable for contribution)  in such  proportion so that Capital  Resources is responsible for that  portion  represented  by the  percentage  that  the fees  paid to  Capital Resources pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public  Offerings and the Company and the Association  shall be responsible for the balance.  If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted  by  applicable  law or if the  indemnified  party  failed to give the notice  required  under  Section 9 above,  then each  indemnifying  party  shall contribute  to such  amount  paid or payable by such  indemnified  party in such proportion  as is  appropriate  to reflect not only such  relative  fault of the Company and the  Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other\n\n\n\n\n\nin connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such losses, claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other from the offering as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the  Association  on the one hand and Capital  Resources  on the other shall be deemed to be in the same  proportion as the total gross  proceeds from the Subscription and Public Offerings (before deducting  expenses) received by the  Company  bear to the total fees (not  including  expenses)  received  by Capital Resources. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates  to information  supplied by the Company  and/or the  Association on the one hand or Capital  Resources on the other and the parties'  relative  intent,  good faith, knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Association and Capital Resources agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were  determined by pro rata  allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified  party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action,  proceedings or claims in  respect  thereof)  referred  to above in this  Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that Capital  Resources shall not be liable for any loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate  exceeds the amount paid  (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to Capital  Resources under this Agreement.  It is understood that the above-stated  limitation on Capital Resources' liability is essential to Capital Resources and that Capital  Resources  relied upon such limitation and would not have entered into this  Agreement if such  limitation  had not been agreed to by the  parties  to this  Agreement.  No  person  found  guilty  of any  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled  to  contribution  from any  person  who was not  found  guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company and the Association under this Section 10 and under  Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the  Association  may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10,  each of Capital  Resources',  the  Company's  or the  Association's officers and directors and each person,  if any, who controls Capital  Resources or the  Company or the  Association  within the  meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall  have the same  rights to  contribution  as the  Company  and the Association.\n\n                                      -26-\n\nAny  party  entitled  to  contribution,  promptly  after  receipt  of  notice of commencement  of any action,  suit,  claim or  proceeding  against such party in respect of which a claim for  contribution  may be made  against  another  party under this  Section 10, will  notify  such party from whom  contribution  may be sought,  but the  omission  to so notify  such party shall not relieve the party from whom  contribution  may be sought  from any  other  obligation  it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.\n\n                  SECTION  11.  Survival  of  Agreements,   Representations  and Indemnities.  The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the  Association  and Capital Resources and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the  Association set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect,  regardless  of any  termination  or cancellation  of this  Agreement  or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital  Resources,  the Company,  the  Association  or any  indemnified  person referred to in Section 9 hereof,  and shall  survive the issuance of the Shares, and any legal  representative,  successor  or assign of Capital  Resources,  the Association, and any such indemnified person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n                  SECTION 12.  Termination.  Capital Resources may terminate  this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n                  (a) In the event the  Company  fails to sell all of the Shares within the period  specified,  and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion  Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Association to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Offering Prospectus,  and no party to this  Agreement  shall have any  obligation to the other  hereunder, except  for  payment  by the  Association  and/or  the  Company  as set forth in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (b) If any of the conditions  specified in Section 8 shall not have been  fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  or by the Closing Date,  or waived in writing  by Capital  Resources,  this  Agreement  and all of Capital Resources  obligations hereunder may be canceled by Capital Resources by notifying the Association of such  cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the  Closing  Date,  and,  any  such  cancellation  shall be without  Liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise  provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (c) If Capital Resources elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this section,  the Company and the Association  shall be notified as provided in Section 13 hereof,  promptly by Capital  Resources  by  telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION  13.

CHANNEL PARTNER RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1 General. Channel Partner will use its reasonable endeavours cooperate with iPass and assist with the implementation of this Agreement and performance of the Services.

In such an event, Channel Partner shall be responsible for payment of all undisputed amounts due and owing to iPass under the Agreement.

A realm is used to uniquely identify a user with a specific End User or group. (An example would be example.com). Realms are created by iPass in cooperation with Channel Partner and the relevant End User. Channel Partner does not own or control these realms by virtue of having registered them with iPass or having paid any fees associated with such registration. Upon request by Channel Partner or the End User, iPass may remove a realm from its system or re-assign a realm to another Channel Partner. 2.4 End User Support. Channel Partner will provide technical and End User support in accordance with Exhibit D. 2.5 End User Satisfaction. iPass may, upon reasonable notice to Channel Partner, directly contact End Users for any reason pertaining to such End User's use of the Service, subject to compliance with local privacy law. Should an End User communicate to Channel Partner or to iPass its dissatisfaction regarding the Services or related matters, the notified party shall promptly give notice to the other party, and iPass and Channel Partner shall work together in good faith to resolve the issue to End User's reasonable satisfaction. If in iPass' reasonable determination the issue is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Channel Partner's receipt of notice of End User's dissatisfaction, iPass may, in addition to other remedies available to iPass, revoke Channel Partner's appointment under Section 1.2 wholly or with respect to such End User and may refer such End User to another iPass channel partner or provide services directly to such End User without any liability to Channel Partner. 2.6 End User Agreements.

Channel Partner will enforce each End User Agreement with at least the same degree of diligence used in enforcing similar agreements pertaining Channel Partner's own services or products but in no event will Channel Partner provide a standard of care in this regard that is less than commercially reasonable. Channel Partner will not waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner shall promptly notify iPass of any material breach of any End User Agreement and will cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in any legal action to mitigate iPass' damages in the event of any such breach. iPass may, and may require Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement.

All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass' other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services ten (10) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due. iPass may include on an invoice, and Channel Partner agrees to pay for: (i) any Services used within one hundred eighty (180) days before the date of the invoice; and (ii) any corrections to amounts invoiced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the original invoice.

To the extent a dispute resolution requires payment of disputed amounts, Channel Partner shall pay such disputed amounts promptly after the dispute is resolved. 3.3 Late Fees. iPass reserves the right to charge interest of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month compounded for the entire overdue period or the maximum amount allowed by law if fees are not paid by their due date. 3.4 Taxes.

If Channel Partner is required by law in Channel Partner's respective country to withhold taxes on payments made to iPass, then Channel Partner shall gross up such payments by the amount of tax withheld. All prices are exclusive of tax. If required to do so by law, iPass will charge sales or value added tax where registered. Otherwise, Channel Partner is liable to self-assess or reverse charge applicable sales or value added tax. For tangible products shipped overseas iPass will not be importer of record. Channel Partner will provide and make available to iPass any resale certificates and other exemption certificates that are related to the taxes that may be due as a result of this Agreement.

Each point in the authentication process is designed with built-in redundancy and fail-over capabilities.\n\nPage 13 of 22 iPass Channel Partner Reseller Agreement 04.18.2018 iPass Confidential\n\n[***] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b- 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nSource: IPASS INC, 8-K, 12/3/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT C SERVICE FEES 1.

Once finalized the Specifications and Implementation Plan may not be changed or modified by either Party, except in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 3(c). (b) Obligations Each of Ehave and CHT shall perform, at their own expense (or as otherwise set out in Schedule \"6\"), their respective obligations and responsibilities set out in the Implementation Plan as necessary to accomplish the development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution in accordance with the milestones and timelines set out therein. CHT acknowledges that the development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution requires decisions and input from CHT and for CHT to perform its obligations thereunder in a timely manner. In the event that CHT delays in providing such decisions, input or performance of its obligations, the development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution shall be correspondingly delayed. Subject to the foregoing, Ehave acknowledges that time is of the essence with respect to its obligations hereunder and that prompt and timely performance of all such obligations, including all development and implementation dates, timetables, project milestones and other requirements in this Agreement is strictly required. Once the implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution is completed, Ehave shall notify CHT of such completion and that the Ehave Companion Solution is ready for testing in accordance with Section 3(d).\n\n7.\n\nSource: EHAVE, INC., 20-F, 5/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Change Control Process Either Party may request additions, deletions or amendments in respect of the development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution (\"Change\"). Changes shall be requested in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party requesting the Change (\"Change Request\"). Ehave shall have no obligation to perform, and CHT shall have no obligation to pay for, services related to any proposed modification or change unless both Parties have agreed to the modifications or changes in writing in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The Change Request shall include a reasonably detailed description of the scope and nature of the requested Change. If CHT desires a Change, Ehave shall evaluate the feasibility of such change as it relates to the proposed Field of Use. As soon as reasonably possible after receipt of CHT's request, Ehave agrees to provide CHT with a written estimate of the cost, if any, of and the timing to implement the requested Changes as well as any additional terms and conditions related to such Changes. The costs, if any, associated with the development of such estimate shall be borne by CHT. Upon CHT's approval in writing of the cost estimate and any additional terms and conditions related to such Changes, including delivery dates and payment terms provided by Ehave, the Parties shall revise the Specifications and Implementation Plan and shall replace the Specifications and Implementation Plan attached hereto as Schedules \"1\" and \"2\", and Ehave shall develop and implement the Change as so agreed. Changes shall be subject to acceptance testing by CHT prior to being deployed into production in accordance with procedures described in Section 3(d) or as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Ehave shall not refuse to accept a CHT Change request unless it is unable to make the Change requested using commercially reasonable efforts, in which event Ehave will provide an explanation to CHT; or Ehave and CHT fail to agree on the terms and conditions related to the performance of such Change, including the costs, if any. If a mutually acceptable resolution is not reached in respect of a CHT Change request, the Parties may submit the issue to mediation pursuant to Section 19(b). (d) Acceptance The criteria (\"Acceptance Criteria\") which the Ehave Companion Solution is to meet and the procedures by which such criteria are to be tested (\"Acceptance Procedures\") shall be set out in the Implementation Plan and shall follow the requirements set out in this Section 3(d). Once notified by Ehave that the Ehave Companion Solution is ready for acceptance testing, CHT shall perform the tests as set out in the Acceptance Procedures. Unless otherwise set out in the Acceptance Procedures, CHT shall have ten (10) Business Days to perform the acceptance tests as set out in the Acceptance Procedures and to provide Ehave written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the Ehave Companion Solution (the \"Acceptance Period\"). CHT shall not refuse to accept the Ehave Companion Solution unless all or one or more portions of the Solution fail to perform, in any material respect, in accordance with the Acceptance Criteria. Any notice of non- acceptance shall describe the material failure of the Ehave Companion Solution in reasonable detail and CHT shall provide Ehave with reasonably detailed documentation and explanations, together with underlying data, to substantiate the failure and to reasonably assist Ehave in its efforts to diagnose and correct the failure. If CHT gives notice to Ehave of non-acceptance of the Ehave Companion Solution then Ehave shall investigate the reported failure in good faith and correct same, and if the engagement is on a fixed fee basis at no additional cost to CHT, within fifteen (15) Business Days unless an extension is granted by CHT. If, within such fifteen (15) Business day period (or extended period, as applicable), Ehave corrects the failure, then Ehave shall give written notice to CHT certifying that the failure has been corrected, and another Acceptance Period of the same duration as the initial Acceptance Period shall begin and shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 3(d) upon delivery of the corrected Ehave Companion Solution to CHT. If the Acceptance Procedures were conducted three (3) times in respect of the initial implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution, and the eHAve Companion Solution failed to pass the Acceptance Criteria on the third (3rd) try, then, at the discretion of either Party, Ehave may continue to fix the problem, or terminate this Agreement in which case, CHT shall promptly return to Ehave all copies of the Ehave Companion Solution, including the Specifications and any other items delivered to CHT by Ehave thereunder and Ehave shall promptly refund to CHT any monies paid by CHT in respect of the initial development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution.

CONFIDENTIALITY (a) Obligation: Each Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information consists of confidential and proprietary information of the disclosing Party. Each Party shall, and shall cause its employees, agents and contractors to hold Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, and shall use the same degree of care by instruction, agreement or otherwise, to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party's Confidential Information that it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information, but with at least a reasonable degree of care commensurate with the nature and importance of such Confidential Information. Each Party agrees not to make use of Confidential Information other than for the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement), and not to release, disclose, communicate it or make it available to any third person other than employees, agents and contractors of the Party who reasonably need to know it in connection with the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations by such Party under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement) and who are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party in writing promptly of any loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of such other Party's Confidential Information and cooperate with such other Party to protect the confidentiality and ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights and other rights therein. (b) Subpoena: In the event that any Party receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority, such Party agrees to (i) immediately notify the other Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request; (ii) consult with the other Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request; and (iii) if disclosure of such Confidential Information is required, exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and/or assist the other Party to obtain, at the other Party's expense, an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the disclosed Confidential Information which the other Party so designates. (c) Injunctive Relief: Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any unauthorized use or disclosure by it of any of the other Party's Confidential Information, in whole or part, will cause irreparable damage to the disclosing Party, that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy and that the amount of such damages would be extremely difficult to measure. The receiving Party agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain the receiving Party from any unauthorized disclosure or use. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing the disclosing Party from pursuing any and all remedies available to it for a breach or threatened breach of a covenant made in this Section 13, including the recovery of monetary damages from the receiving Party.\n\n20.\n\nSource: EHAVE, INC., 20-F, 5/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n14.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to Honeywell IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such Honeywell IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to SpinCo in the event Honeywell does not grant such license, without regard to whether Honeywell has negotiated in good faith).\n\nSection 3.02. Other Covenants.\n\n(a) Honeywell hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Honeywell Group) SpinCo's right, title and interest in and to the SpinCo IP.

By providing written notice, theglobe may terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion if one of the following companies (or their subsidiaries) does an \"Ownership Change Event\": Lycos, Yahoo (including GeoCities, which shall be included even if their proposed merger does not occur), Xoom, Fortune City, Excite, Go Network (including Disney and Infoseek), Snap! (including NBC) and AOL.  An \"Ownership Change Event\" means: (x) the acquisition of 50% or more of Boxlot's equity or voting interests; (y) a merger or consolidation of Boxlot; or (z) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of Boxlot's assets related to the Service.\n\n     8.4  Termination for Changes.  By providing written notice, theglobe may terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion if: (a) Boxlot's business model changes such that the Service is no longer Boxlot's primary line of business, or (b) at the one year anniversary of the Launch Date, the Service is significantly inferior to the comparable services being offered by the market leaders in the person to person auction space.\n\n     8.5  Termination for Failure to Grow.

Thus, in the event that this Agreement terminates under Section 8.2  [Termination for Failure to Perform] due to Boxlot's failure to perform (excluding the cross-reference to Section 12.7  [Force Majeure]) prior to the end of the applicable year, Boxlot shall immediately pay to theglobe the amount necessary to pay the total year's placement fee for that year.  Boxlot waives any right to assert that the foregoing fee is a liquidated damage or a penalty.\n\n9.  NO WARRANTIES.

GENERAL.\n\n     12.1  Compliance with Laws. At its own expense, Boxlot shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Boxlot shall (a) obtain all governmental approval, permits and licenses, and make all governmental filings and registrations, necessary for the marketing and performance of the Service in every United States jurisdiction, (b) ensure that theglobe is not required to obtain any governmental approval, permits or licenses as a result of this Agreement, theglobe's performance hereunder or any payments made to theglobe hereunder, and (c) promptly resolve any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest.\n\n     12.2  Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court in New York City, NY.\n\n     12.3  Publicity. Prior to the release of any press releases or other similar promotional materials related to this Agreement, the releasing party shall submit a written request for approval to the other party with a copy of the materials to be released, which request shall be made no less than 3 business days prior to the requested release date. A party shall not unreasonably withhold or delay the granting of its approval of such materials. The parties shall issue the first press release jointly.\n\n     12.4  Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, franchise, joint venture or employment relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Neither party shall make any warranties or representations on behalf of the other party.\n\n     12.5  Assignment.  Neither party may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder (except to an affiliated company, or to a successor in interest in the event of a merger, sale of assets of the business to which this Agreement is related, or consolidation) without the other party's prior written consent, and any purported attempt to do so is null and void.\n\n     12.6  Severability; Headings.  If any provision herein is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way.  The parties agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.  Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.\n\n     12.7  Force Majeure.  Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is interfered with by any condition beyond a party's reasonable control, the affected party, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to\n\n                                       9\n\n  the extent of such condition. However, if a force majeure detrimentally affects a party's performance of a material covenant hereunder for 14 days or more, the other party can terminate this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that website operations may be affected by numerous factors outside of a party's control. In the case of Boxlot's performance, a Boxlot force majeure includes theglobe's failure to perform its obligations described in this Agreement or an outage that affects the entire Internet in the United States; however, in no event shall a failure of any Boxlot supplier or vendor be deemed a Boxlot force majeure.\n\n     12.8  Notice.  Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by personal delivery, overnight courier, confirmed facsimile, confirmed email, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and will be deemed given upon personal delivery, 1 day after deposit with an overnight courier, 5 days after deposit in the mail, or upon confirmation of receipt of facsimile or email.  Notices will be sent to a party at its address set forth above or such other address as that party may specify in writing pursuant to this Section.\n\n     12.9  Entire Agreement; Waiver.  This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to the subject matter of the Agreement.  This Agreement may be changed only by a writing signed by both parties.  The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.\n\n     12.10  Equity Stake.  Boxlot shall grant to theglobe, pursuant to industry- standard terms negotiated between the parties in good faith, immediately vested options to purchase shares of common stock equal to up to 4% of Boxlot's fully diluted capital stock (in accordance with the chart below).  Theglobe shall be restricted from exercising such options until the first anniversary of the Effective Date, and such options shall have a five-year term.  Each such option shall have an exercise price equal to the lesser of (1) the price at which Boxlot's common stock is sold to the public in an initial public offering or (2) $6 per share; each of the foregoing as may be adjusted for any stock splits, combinations or re-organizations affecting Boxlot's capital stock.

The only login or registration that should be required to access the Service or the Co-Branded Pages is theglobe Site's login or registration.  Because Boxlot hosts the Service and the Co-Branded Pages, theglobe will pass to Boxlot information about each User accessing the Service or the Co-Branded Pages as described below:\n\n .    Accounts will be created for each User via a one-time \"welcome\" page      (hosted by theglobe) when the User tries to access the portion of the      Service requiring such registration for the first time.\n\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include registration fields for any information      about the User needed to use the Service but not currently in theglobe's      database.\n\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include a \"Privacy Policy\" informing the User that      their data is being passed to a third party (Boxlot) in order to use the      Services.\n\n .    Any additional required User information is collected and entered into      theglobe's database. Then, the required User information is sent to Boxlot      all at once to create the new account. theglobe will include the User's      \"username\" and \"UserID#\" in the data passed to Boxlot.\n\nAdditional notes on account creation:\n\n .    The User will only see the \"Welcome\" page until they consent to the privacy      policy and enter any required information. This page will not appear after      the User completes the initial account creation process.\n\n .    Account information stored on Boxlot's servers in connection to the Service      will need to be kept in parity with theglobe. To do so, the parties shall      work together to implement a mechanism for updating information on Boxlot's      servers when User information changes on theglobe Site.\n\n .    The technology used to pass the data to Boxlot for account creation and      ongoing account updates will be determined jointly by Boxlot and theglobe.\n\n .    The UserID# theglobe passes to Boxlot during account creation will be      stored by Boxlot in association with each User. This UserID# is necessary      to link individual user reporting and individual account updates between      Boxlot and theglobe on an ongoing basis.\n\n                                       18\n\nSource: THEGLOBE COM INC, S-1/A, 5/3/1999", "clauses": [{"start": 44, "end": 64, "text": "CO-BRANDING Agreement", "fine_label": "document name", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 313, "end": 330, "text": "The Boxlot Company", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 317, "end": 322, "text": "Boxlot", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 194, "end": 211, "text": "theglobe.com, Inc.", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 194, "end": 201, "text": "theglobe", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 140, "end": 154, "text": "March ___, 1999", "fine_label": "agreement date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 140, "end": 154, "text": "March ___, 1999", "fine_label": "effective date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1606, "text": "\"Launch Date\" means the first date on which the Service is made publicly available.", "fine_label": "expiration date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 19589, "end": 19713, "text": "This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date and will continue in effect for 2 years following the Launch Date.", "fine_label": "expiration date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 26931, "end": 27261, "text": "This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

After Fox has approved a Beta Prototype, Licensee shall be free to release the Beta Prototype as a final commercial product.\n\n(A) Modifications: After approval of a Beta Prototype, Licensee shall not modify the Wireless Products without the prior written approval of Fox. For purposes of this paragraph, porting, enhancements, optimization (which alters the content displayed in any material manner) and localization shall be deemed a modification requiring Fox's prior written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Porting that does not require substantive changes to a Wireless Product will not be deemed a modification requiring Fox's prior approval.\n\n(b) Approval Process:\n\n(i) Evaluation: Fox shall approve or reject in writing all Treatments, Design Documents, Alpha Prototypes, and Beta Prototypes submitted to it for its approval (each individually a \"Deliverable\"). Fox's approval or rejection of all Deliverables shall be rendered in good faith.\n\n(ii) Rejection: If Fox rejects any Deliverable, Fox shall provide to Licensee, in writing, the reasons for its rejection of that Deliverable. Licensee shall then use commercially reasonable efforts to make the changes to that Deliverable and resubmit the Deliverable to Fox for Fox's reconsideration.

Licensee understands and agrees that approval of any two-dimensional artwork does not constitute approval of the implementation of the artwork in the Wireless Products.\n\n(iv) Timing: Fox shall endeavor to approve or reject in writing all Deliverables and all materials submitted to it for its approval within two (2) weeks of Fox's receipt thereof. If Fox does not approve or reject in writing a Deliverable within two (2) weeks of its receipt and causes a significant delay in the development of the\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n\n\n***** The omitted portions of this exhibit have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under Rule 406 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n-16-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless Products, then Fox and Licensee shall mutually and in good faith discuss and agree to any adjustments in the Wireless Products Latest Commencement Date which are necessary due to such delay. Fox shall not terminate this Agreement for Licensee's delay in delivery of the Wireless Products, where such delay is solely caused by Fox's failure to deliver the PSM Materials in a timely manner in accordance with Paragraph 2(a)(i). Fox reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 2(b)(i) where Licensee's delay in delivery of the Wireless Products is the result of Fox's disapproval of the Deliverables.\n\n10.

Licensee hereby does irrevocably transfer and assign to Fox any and all Moral Rights that Licensee may have in Fox's Intellectual Property Rights in and to the PSM and the Fox Intellectual Property and any derivative works thereof and shall cause Licensee's employees and contractors, including Licensee's developers of the Wireless Products, to do likewise.

In this Statement of Privacy Principles these businesses are collectively called the News America Group. At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort. This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group's U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice.* The News America Group is actively involved in the ongoing privacy debate and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology.\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nThe News America Group obtains personally identifiable information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personally identifiable information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services.

A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow   you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1.   Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2.   The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3.   Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6.   The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7.   i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.\n\nFor more information about I-Escrow, visit their web-site at www.iescrow.com\n\nSource: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999", "clauses": [{"start": 44, "end": 80, "text": "CO-BRANDING AND ADVERTISING AGREEMENT", "fine_label": "document name", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 303, "end": 320, "text": "2THEMART.COM, INC.", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 166, "end": 179, "text": "I-ESCROW, INC.", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 287, "end": 294, "text": "i-Escrow", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 427, "end": 434, "text": "2TheMart", "fine_label": "parties", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 114, "end": 126, "text": "June 21, 1999", "fine_label": "agreement date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 114, "end": 126, "text": "June 21, 1999", "fine_label": "effective date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 15054, "end": 15184, "text": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein.", "fine_label": "expiration date", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 15363, "end": 15523, "text": "A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.", "fine_label": "renewal term", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 15526, "end": 15666, "text": "In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.", "fine_label": "renewal term", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 15363, "end": 15523, "text": "A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.", "fine_label": "notice period to terminate renewal", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 15526, "end": 15666, "text": "In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.", "fine_label": "notice period to terminate renewal", "broad_label": "Metadata"}, {"start": 21948, "end": 22101, "text": "This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.", "fine_label": "governing law", "broad_label": "Metadata"}]}

TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\n                  1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"). However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.\n\n                  1.2 Hydron shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Dolphins at any time between November 1, 1997 and December 15, 1997, in which event this Agreement shall be terminated following the Dolphins last 1997 regular or post-season game, if any. If Hydron does not timely exercise its right to terminate this Agreement, then Hydron agrees that this Agreement shall continue for the entire four (4) year term unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement.\n\n         2.       SPONSORSHIP RIGHTS\n\n                  2.1 For the Term of this Agreement, the Dolphins will provide Hydron with certain advertising and promotional benefits as are set forth in and in accordance with Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (the \"Sponsorship Rights\").\n\n                  2.2 For the Term of this Agreement, Hydron shall be designated as a sponsor of the Dolphins in the Sunscreen/Skin Care Category (as defined below) and a licensee of the Marks (as defined below) in the Sunscreen/Skin Category by the Dolphins. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category\" means the product category consisting of sunscreen, sun protection and similar skin care products.\n\n                  2.3 The Sponsorship Rights granted by the Dolphins to Hydron are subject to\n\ntermination in whole or in part at any time upon written notice to Hydron if such Sponsorship Rights conflict with any exclusive advertising rights granted by NFL Properties, Inc. to one of its advertisers or sponsors. In the event of any such termination of exclusivity, the non-terminated Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron by the Dolphins shall nonetheless continue for the remainder of the Term and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply. As of the date hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any claim by NFL Properties that the Sponsorship Rights violate or conflict with exclusive rights granted by NFL Properties.\n\n         3.       CONSIDERATION\n\n                  3.1 In consideration of the Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron hereunder:\n\n                            (a) Hydron shall pay to the Dolphins an aggregate amount of $96,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) as follows: Hydron shall pay Dolphins the sum of $24,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000.\n\n                  3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.\n\n                  3.3 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including Exhibit \"A\", each of the parties shall pay its own expenses of performing its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.       USE OF MARKS\n\n                  4.1 Hydron and the Dolphins may use the name, logos, colors, trademarks, service marks, or other identifying features (\"Marks\") of the other, as specifically contemplated in connection with the Sponsorship Rights, subject to any limitations set forth in this Agreement.\n\n                  4.2 All advertising material and any use of the other parties' Marks by a party is subject to the prior written approval of the Mark owner. Either party shall submit all such materials or proposed usage of a Mark to the other party at least two weeks prior to its intended use. The Mark owner shall have the right to inspect and require changes or deletions (including the right to disapprove of such advertisement or use of Marks in their entirety) of advertising and promotional copy or material that the Mark owner may deem to be contrary to its policies or best interests. Such requirements will not be unreasonably imposed, and the foregoing approvals and\n\n                                        2\n\nrequirements will be consistently given and imposed on all sponsors or users of the Marks, as the case may be.\n\n                  4.3 Any and all public announcements or press releases by or on behalf of the other party regarding the Sponsorship Rights or the details of this Agreement shall be subject to the consent of the other party, and each party shall have the right to approve in advance the contents and timing thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dolphins acknowledge that Hydron, as a publicly held company, has disclosure obligations pursuant to the federal securities laws. Hydron agrees to take the comments of the Dolphins into account in preparing and disseminating such disclosure, but notwithstanding comments from the Dolphins, Hydron shall make such disclosure as may be required by law.\n\n                  4.4 For purposes of this Agreement, the Dolphins and Hydron expressly recognize that the Marks are the unique, valid and exclusive property of the respective owner of the Mark. The Dolphins and Hydron agree that they shall not, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, directly or indirectly, contest the validity of the other's Marks or any of the registrations pertaining thereto, in the United States or elsewhere, nor adopt the other's Marks or any term, word, mark or designation which is in any aspect confusingly similar to the other's Marks. The Dolphins and Hydron specifically acknowledges that any use of the Marks pursuant to this Agreement shall not create for the Dolphins or Hydron any right, title or interest in the other's Marks.

Upon termination of this Agreement, the Dolphins and Hydron shall immediately terminate all use of the other's Marks.\n\n                  4.5 Hydron expressly recognizes that the Dolphins have previously granted the exclusive rights to license and sublicense its Marks to NFL Properties, Inc., and that the grant to Hydron of the right to use the Marks is subject to the prior approval of NFL Properties, Inc. In the event that such approval is not so given by NFL Properties, Inc., then such usage rights of Hydron shall immediately terminate. The Dolphins represent that they will use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of NFL Properties, Inc. to the execution and performance of this Agreement prior to their execution hereof. In any such event, the provisions of Section 8.2 will apply.\n\n         5.       STADIUM POLICY; GOVERNING LEAGUE POLICIES\n\n                  5.1 Hydron and the Dolphins agree that this Agreement shall be performed in accordance with rules and policies of the Stadium as may be applicable to this Agreement, if any. The Dolphins will advise Hydron of any development of or changes in these rules and policies that might adversely affect the terms of this Agreement.\n\n                  5.2 The parties agree that this Agreement shall automatically be subject to any new or amended National Football League (the \"NFL\") rules or regulations applicable to advertising or promotional benefits provided by NFL member teams to its sponsors effective as\n\n                                        3\n\nof the date such regulation shall take effect and that this Agreement shall incorporate and be subject to the Constitution, By-Laws, rules and regulations, the duly authorized resolutions of the governing body, the decrees and rulings of the commissioner and the terms and conditions of any and all agreements to which the NFL is a party and as to which the NFL has bound its member clubs (collectively all of such regulations, resolutions, decrees and agreements are referred to as the \"Governing League Policies\"). The Dolphins shall advise Hydron of any changes therein which may materially and adversely affect the Sponsorship Rights. As of the date hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any claim by the NFL that the Sponsorship Rights violate any Governing League Rules.\n\n                  5.3 Without limiting any other potential uses of the Dolphins' Marks, Hydron agrees that the Dolphins may allow or authorize any League Sponsor (as defined below) to engage in advertising and promotional activities in the Dolphins' local market (including, without limitation, the Stadium), or\n\n\n\n\n\notherwise provide benefits to such League Sponsor, if such League Sponsor is entitled to engage in such activities or receive such benefits pursuant to any sponsorship or promotional licensing arrangement now or hereafter entered into between such League Sponsor and the NFL or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, NFL Properties, Inc., NFL Enterprises, Inc. and NFL Films, Inc.). For purposes of this Agreement the term, \"League Sponsor\" shall mean any person or entity which currently is, or at any time becomes a sponsor or promotional licensee of or with respect to any NFL event or program now or hereafter in existence. By way of illustration only and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, League Sponsors may place advertising and promotional materials (including displays) in the Stadium, in connection with a League event, such as the Super Bowl.\n\n                  5.4 If any rule or regulation of the Stadium, or any Governing League Policy as described in Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 requires the termination or revision of any Sponsorship Right, such Sponsorship Right shall be revised or terminated upon written notice to Hydron and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply to such termination or revisions.\n\n         6.

S2K will market the Funds to Intermediaries that: (a) are registered as \"broker-dealers\" with the SEC, FINRA, and any other applicable jurisdiction in which they operate and are required to be so registered by law;\n\nSource: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) will enter into a Selling Agreement agreed to by Distributor and such \"broker-dealers,\" or in such other form of Intermediary agreement (which shall include, without limitation, broker/dealer Selling Agreements, platform agreements and wirehouse agreements) as required by an Intermediary with the Distributor to sell shares of the Funds to investors (copies of which shall be made available to S2K); and (c) will sell shares of the Funds through representatives in accordance with the then-current applicable Prospectus and in accordance with the provisions of the Selling Agreement. 2.

(b) Advertising and Sales Literature Review (i) The Distributor shall provide review of broker-dealer related advertising and sales literature pieces (\"marketing pieces\") submitted to Distributor by S2K. Documentation (which shall include electronic correspondence) not defined as \"marketing pieces,\" which shall include, but is not limited to, correspondence and materials provided directly in response to due diligence requests, shall be principally reviewed and approved by S2K. (ii) Distributor's services are based on the understanding that S2K will utilize current systems and expertise owned by Distributor, specifically the AdLit Advertising Review System (\"AdLit\"), and that Distributor will base its reviews on: (i) the guidelines contained within Distributor's Sales and Advertising Guide and Distributor's Written Supervisory Procedures; (ii) rules and guidance issued by FINRA and the SEC related to communications with the public and/or communications to institutional investors, as those terms are defined in FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211 and in various other FINRA and SEC rules and interpretive material; and (iii) Distributor's submission guidelines with respect to the use of trademarked and/or copyright materials, to the extent applicable.

In the event of the latter, the item will be approved by the registered principal and filed with the applicable regulatory body if necessary;\n\n- 2 -\n\nSource: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nc) Distributor will provide system training and ongoing consulting with respect to advertising review guidelines and rules for each marketing piece submitted via the process described herein; and d) Distributor will make all required FINRA filings of marketing materials which have been approved by Distributor.

Web pages and other marketing pieces over 30 pages require a more in-depth review; therefore, Distributor cannot guarantee a one business day review for these items. c) The marketing piece must be submitted via Distributor's AdLit system by no later than 3:00 P.M. Mountain Time (2:00 P.M. PT/5:00 P.M.

S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor. 4.

Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective. If this Agreement is terminated by one party, it shall terminate the entire Agreement.\n\n- 3 -\n\nSource: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

(a) Each party to this Agreement shall safeguard and hold confidential from disclosure to unauthorized parties all Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other party or parties. For purposes of this Section 8, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all information which is in any way connected with, derived from or related to the business of a party, including without limitation, any business and financial records, any retail or institutional customer information, computer programs, technical data, investment information, lists, compilations, compositions, programs, plans, devices, descriptions, drawings, methods, techniques, processes, designs, theories concepts or ideas, and any information relating to the pricing or marketing policies, suppliers or customers of a party.\n\n- 7 -\n\nSource: CC REAL ESTATE INCOME FUND-ADV, POS 8C, 12/5/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Confidential Information shall not include information to the extent such information is (i) already known to the receiving party free of any restriction at the time obtained, including information in the public domain; (ii) subsequently learned from an independent third party free of restriction; (iii) known through no wrongful act of any party; or (iv) independently developed by one party without reference to information which is confidential.

If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Non-Disclosing Party, the Disclosing Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel advises the Disclosing Party is required to be disclosed, provided that the Disclosing Party attempt to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Non-Disclosing Party, at the Non-Disclosing Party's expense, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. (d) Each party further acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of a breach by it of the provisions of this Section 8, the other party or parties will suffer irreparable harm and damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. (e) The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 9. Fund Materials.
