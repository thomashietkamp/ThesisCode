Immediately upon notification from PPI, such post termination  sales shall cease.   17.4 Other Remedies of EKR. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that EKR is entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.1(a), in addition to the right to terminate as provided therein and any other remedies EKR  may have hereunder, PPI shall assist EKR in the transfer of the manufacture of the Products, including the Specifications from PPI to EKR  or EKR's designee. In such event, the Royalty payments payable hereunder shall continue to be paid; provided,  however, that all costs  incurred by EKR in the transfer of manufacturing information from PPI and obtaining FDA approval of the manufacture of the Products by  EKR or EKR's designee, and any other amounts due to EKR, shall be deducted from any royalties payable to PPI. In addition, PPI shall  during the remainder of the Term and for a period of up to [**] ([**]) years thereafter continue to manufacture and supply the Product to  EKR at cost without mark-up until such time that EKR can secure an FDA approved manufacturing facility for the Product. PPI shall provide such advice as necessary for EKR to arrange for an alternative manufacturer and shall provide EKR with access to all relevant PPI  Know-How, and any other information necessary for EKR to transfer such manufacturing to an alternate manufacturer. In addition, (i) PPI  shall transfer to EKR any Marketing Authorizations held by PPI and (ii) the Trademark license granted under Section 2.3 shall continue in  effect following such termination on a perpetual basis and EKR shall be responsible for all costs associated with the maintenance of such  Trademark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -58-\n\n17.5 EKR Step-In Rights.\n\n\n\n(a) During the Term, in the event EKR has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 16.1(a) - (i) hereof (the \"Step-in  Right Trigger Event\"), and EKR does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement under such Section, EKR shall  have the option to exercise step-in rights to manufacture the Product for the remainder of the Term (the \"Step-in Right\") by  providing PPI written notice of such election within ninety (90) days after the Step-in Right Trigger Event (or such longer  period as mutually agreed by the Parties) (the \"Step-in Right Notice\"); provided that in the event such Step-in Right  Trigger Event has been cured prior to EKR's exercise of the Step-in Right, the Step-in Right shall terminate with respect to  such Step-in Right Trigger Event. The Step-in Right Notice shall specify the date which EKR intends to exercise the rights  associated with the Step-in Right.\n\n  (b) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, PPI shall, at EKR's cost and expense, cooperate in the exercise of such rights  and EKR shall reimburse PPI for the reasonable costs PPI incurs in assisting EKR in the exercise of such rights within thirty  (30) days of EKR's receipt of invoice.\n\n\n\n(c) The Step-in Right shall include, without limitation, and to the extent allowable under Applicable Law, PPI's grant to EKR of  such additional license rights, rights of access, rights of observation and rights of management, direction and control, in  each case solely with respect to the manufacture and supply of Product and as reasonably necessary to enable and permit  EKR (or EKR's designee) to ensure that the supply of Product shall continue to be available to EKR under this Agreement  and the Supply Agreement; provided that EKR in exercising the Step-in Right shall not (i) unreasonably interfere with PPI's  other activities at the facilities at which the Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -59-\n\n\n\notherwise handled (\"Product Facilities\") or (ii) require PPI to take any action or fail to take any action that does or could  reasonably be expected to interfere with PPI's other activities at the Product Facilities. The foregoing rights shall apply  with respect to any Product Facility to the extent necessary for EKR to preserve and protect supply of the Product as  contemplated by this Agreement and the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) upon termination of the Lease  Term, PPI shall maintain responsibility and control over all other products manufactured by PPI and nothing in this Section  17.5 shall give EKR any rights to direct, manage or control the manufacture of such products (ii) PPI shall maintain  responsibility and control over the facilities where Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled  and nothing in this Section 17.5 shall give EKR general oversight or control of the facilities where Product is manufactured,  tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled.\n\n  (d) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, EKR shall comply with all policies applicable to the facilities where Product is  manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled and all Applicable Laws with respect to the manufacture of the  Product.\n\n18. Force Majeure   18.1 Obligation to Perform. Except for payment obligations which shall not be excused or affected by any Force Majeure, neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement or shall be liable to the other under this Agreement for loss or damages attributable to any Force  Majeure, provided the Party affected shall give prompt notice thereof to the other Party. Subject to Section 18.2, the Party giving such  notice shall be excused from such of its obligations hereunder for so long as it continues to be affected by Force Majeure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -60-\n\n18.2 Duration. If such Force Majeure continues unabated for a period of at least ninety (90) days, the Parties will meet to discuss in good faith  what actions to take or what modifications should be made to this Agreement as a consequence of such Force Majeure in order to alleviate  its consequences on the affected Party. If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this  Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this  Agreement.\n\n19.

Subject to Section 20.2, neither Party shall, nor shall it purport to, assign, license, transfer or change any of its rights or  obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 20.4 either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an  Affiliate or to any successor by merger, consolidation, sale of stock or other equity interests or the sale of substantially all of the assets of  such Party without the consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its  rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction.   20.2 Sub-Distribution. EKR may appoint sub-distributors under this Agreement provided that EKR:\n\n  (a) informs PPI of the identity of any Third Party sub-distributor (other than Affiliate companies) prior to the execution of any  sub-distribution agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -62-\n\n  (b) obtain a confidential nondisclosure agreement with the prospective Sub-Distributor in a form acceptable to PPI, which  acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and containing terms at least as stringent as those terms  included in Article 11 of this Agreement;\n\n  (c) deliver to the prospective Sub-Distributor a redacted copy of this Agreement (\"Redacted Agreement\") .  Any sub- distribution agreement shall provide that such agreement is subject and subordinate to the rights of PPI under this  Agreement; and\n\n  (d) provides PPI with a copy of written sub-distribution agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution  thereof by EKR.   20.3 Responsibility of EKR. Notwithstanding any such sub-distribution agreement, EKR shall remain primarily liable to PPI for its obligations hereunder, and for any act or omission of any sub-distributor.   20.4 Change of Control. Should there be a Change of Control of either Party resulting in the control of such Party by a Third Party which  markets or sells a Competing Product in any part of the Territory, then the rights under this Agreement may not be assigned without the  express consent of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. \"Change of Control\" shall mean (a) the sale, lease,  exchange, license or disposition of all or substantially all of the Party's assets in one transaction or series of related transactions or (b) a  merger or consolidation with an unaffiliated Third Party as a result of which the holders of the Party's issued and outstanding voting  securities immediately before such transaction own or control less than a majority of the voting securities of the continuing or surviving  entity immediately after such transaction. The issuance by either Party of securities in connection with any financing transaction or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -63-\n\n\n\npublic offering shall not be deemed a Change of Control under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of Section  6.3(b)(iii): (i) references to a \"Party\" in the above definition of Change of Control shall be deemed to include PPI as well as any Affiliate of  PPI and (ii) a Change of Control shall also include (in addition to any of the transactions described above in the definition of Change of  Control), any sale of securities of PPI or its Affiliates directly by the holder (the \"Holder\") of such securities (other than to an Affiliate of  such Holder) in which such sale results in a transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of PPI or its Affiliates.\n\n21.

If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall  be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of  this Agreement.   21.9 Delay. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy provided by law under or pursuant to this Agreement shall  impair such right or remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time and no  single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or  remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(signature page follows)      -65-\n\n21.10 Cumulative Rights.

It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for epidural use.

Subject to the Wind-Down Budget and payment of Expenses, Agent may use Merchant's employees in the conduct of the Sale to the extent Agent deems necessary for the Sale, and Agent may select and schedule the number and type of Merchant's employees required for the Sale. Agent shall identify any such employees to be used in connection with the Sale (each such employee, a \"Retained Employee\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant's employees shall at all times remain employees of Merchant. Agent's selection and scheduling of Merchant's employees shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Merchant and Agent agree that, except to the extent that wages and benefits of Retained Employees constitute Expenses hereunder, nothing contained in this Agreement and none of Agent's actions taken in respect of the Sale shall be deemed to constitute an assumption by Agent of any of Merchant's obligations relating to any of Merchant's employees including, without limitation, Excluded Payroll Benefits, Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act (\"WARN Act\") claims and other termination type claims and obligations, or any other amounts required to be paid by statute or law; nor shall Agent become liable under any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or be deemed a joint or successor employer with respect to such employees. For the avoidance of doubt, Merchant shall be responsible for providing any required notice under the WARN Act with respect to its employees and otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any \"plant closing\" or \"mass layoff' (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting the employees, whether before or after the date of this Agreement. Merchant shall not, without the prior consent of Agent, raise the salary or wages or increase the benefits for, or pay any bonuses\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 25 of 60\n\nor other extraordinary payments to, any Store or Distribution Center employees prior to the Sale Termination Date. Merchant shall not transfer any employee in anticipation of the Sale nor any Retained Employee during the Sale Term, in each case without Agent's prior consent. To the extent reasonably requested by Agent, and at Agent's expense, Merchant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hire additional temporary employees to facilitate the GOB Sale, which employees shall constitute Retained Employees for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n9.2 Termination of Employees. Agent may in its discretion stop using any Retained Employee at any time during the Sale, subject to the conditions provided for herein. In the event that Agent desires to cease using any Retained Employee, Agent shall notify Merchant at least seven (7) days prior thereto; provided, however, that, in the event that Agent determines to cease using an employee \"for cause\" (such as dishonesty, fraud or breach of employee duties), the seven (7) day notice period shall not apply; provided, further, however, that Agent shall immediately notify Merchant of the basis for such \"cause.\" From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Sale Termination Date, Merchant shall not transfer or dismiss employees of the Stores or Distribution Centers except \"for cause\" without Agent's prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not have the right to terminate the actual employment of any employee, but rather may only cease using such employee in the Sale and paying any Expenses with respect to such employee (and all decisions relating to the termination or non-termination of such employees shall at all times rest solely with Merchant).\n\n9.3 Payroll Matters. During the Sale Term, Merchant shall process the payroll for all Retained Employees and any former employees and temporary labor engaged for the Sale. Each Wednesday (or such other date as may be reasonably requested by Merchant to permit the funding of the payroll accounts before such payroll is due and payable) during the Sale Term, Agent shall transfer to Merchant's payroll accounts an amount equal to the base payroll for Retained Employees plus related payroll taxes, workers' compensation and benefits for such week, to the extent such amount constitutes Expenses hereunder.\n\n9.4 Employee Retention Bonuses. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, Agent may pay, as an Expense, retention bonuses and/or severance pay (\"Retention Bonuses\") (which bonuses shall be inclusive of payroll taxes, but as to which no benefits shall be payable), up to a maximum of $7,400,000 in the aggregate, to such Retained Employees who do not voluntarily leave employment, are not otherwise entitled to receive severance pay, and are not terminated \"for cause,\" as Agent may determine in its discretion. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of such Retention Bonuses shall be in an amount to be determined by Agent, in its discretion, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days after the Sale Termination Date, and shall be processed through Merchant's payroll system.\n\nSection 10.

The Sale shall be conducted so that the Stores in which sales are to occur will remain open no longer than during the normal hours of operation provided for in the respective leases for the Stores.\n\nB. The Sale shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and local \"Blue Laws\", where applicable, so that no Sale shall be conducted on Sunday unless the Merchant had been operating such Store on a Sunday.\n\nC. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not distribute handbills, leaflets or other written materials to customers outside of any Stores' premises, unless permitted by the lease or, if distribution is customary in the \"shopping center\" in which such Store is located; provided that Agent may solicit customers in the Stores themselves. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not use any flashing lights or amplified sound to advertise the Sale or solicit customers, except as permitted under the applicable lease or agreed to by the landlord.\n\nD. At the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent shall vacate the Stores in broom clean condition; provided that Agent may abandon any FF&E not sold in the Sale at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices at the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, without cost or liability of any kind to Agent. Any abandoned FF&E left in a Store or Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices after a lease is rejected shall be deemed abandoned to the landlord having a right to dispose of the same as the landlord chooses without any liability whatsoever on the part of the landlord to any party and without waiver of any damage claims against the Merchant. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility or liability of any kind, any FF&E located at a Store or, Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nE. Following, and subject to, the entry of the Approval Order, Agent may advertise the Sale as a \"store closing\", \"sale on everything\", \"everything must go\" or similar-themed sale, as dictated by the Approval Order.\n\nF. Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order. Nothing contained in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 59 of 60\n\nF. Conspicuous signs shall be posted in the cash register areas of each of the affected Stores to effect that \"all sales are final.\"\n\nG. Except with respect to the hanging of exterior banners, Agent shall not make any alterations to the storefront or exterior walls of any Stores.\n\nH. Agent shall not make any alterations to interior or exterior Store lighting. No property of the landlord of a Store shall be removed or sold during the Sale. The hanging of exterior banners or in- Store signage and banners shall not constitute an alteration to a Store.\n\nI. Agent shall keep Store premises and surrounding areas clear and orderly consistent with present practices.\n\nJ. Subject to the provisions of the Agreement, Agent shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Closing Stores and the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters and (subject to any side letter between JV Agent and Purchaser, which shall not in any way affect Merchant's rights under the Agreement) and Purchaser shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. JV Agent may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Closing Stores and the Indiana Distribution Center and Purchaser may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. The purchasers of any Owned FF&E sold during the sale shall be permitted to remove the Owned FF&E either through the back shipping areas at any time, or through other areas after applicable business hours. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or the termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility, any FF&E at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, and Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nK. Agent shall be entitled to include Additional Agent Merchandise in the Sale in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order and the Agreement.\n\nL. At the conclusion of the Sale at each Store, pending assumption or rejection of applicable leases, the landlords of the Stores shall have reasonable access to the Stores' premises as set forth in the applicable leases. The Merchant, Agent and their agents and representatives shall continue to have access to the Stores as provided for in the Agreement.\n\nM. Post-petition rents shall be paid by the Merchant as required by the Bankruptcy Code until the rejection or assumption and assignment of each lease. Agent shall have no responsibility to the landlords therefor.\n\nN. The rights of landlords against Merchant for any damages to a Store shall be reserved in accordance with the provisions of the applicable lease.\n\nO. If and to the extent that the landlord of any Store affected hereby contends that Agent or Merchant is in breach of or default under these Sale Guidelines, such landlord shall email or deliver written notice by overnight delivery on the Merchant, JV Agent and Purchaser as follows:\n\nIf to Agent:\n\nGreat American Group, LLC Attn: Scott Carpenter (scarpenter@greatamerican.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 60 of 60 Alan Forman (aforman@brileyfin.com)\n\nand\n\nTiger Capital Group, LLC Attn: Christopher Huber (chuber@tigergroup.com) Mark Naughton (mnaughton@tigergroup.com)\n\nand\n\nWilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB Attn: [_]\n\nWith copies (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\nLowenstein Sandler LLP Counsel to Great American Group LLC Attn: Kenneth A.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the payment provided for in this Article IV is not intended to constitute consideration for the Purchased Assets and Licensed Assets, payment for the license of which is provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n                                 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n      5.1 Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party represents and warrants to the Disclosing Party that:\n\n            5.1.1 it will keep and maintain all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure;\n\n            5.1.2 it will not, directly or indirectly, disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the Disclosing Party's prior written consent;\n\n            5.1.3 it will not make use of any Confidential Information for its own purposes, such as creation of a competitive product; or for the benefit of anyone or any entity other than as contemplated by this Agreement;\n\n            5.1.4 upon the Disclosing Party's written request, at the earlier of the end of the Term, or receipt of notice from the Disclosing Party of a breach by it of this Agreement or an Annex, the Receiving Party will deliver promptly to the Disclosing Party or, at the Receiving Party's option, will destroy all memoranda, notes, records, reports, media and other documents and materials (and all copies thereof) regarding or including any Confidential Information which the Receiving Party may then possess or have under its control; and\n\n            5.1.5 it will take no action with respect to the Confidential Information that is inconsistent with its confidential and proprietary nature.\n\n      5.2 Exceptions to Non-Disclosure Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement.\n\n      5.3 Receiving Party's Duty of Care. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                                   WARRANTIES\n\n      6.1 On2 Warranties. On2 makes the following representations and warranties to Wildform.\n\n      (a)   Authorization; Power and Authority.

Wildform (i) is a corporation             duly organized under the laws of the State of California, (ii) has             the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into             and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) to the             best of Wildform's knowledge as of the Effective Date, the             Deliverables marked as Deliverable #2 will not infringe any             Intellectual Property Rights held by any third party.\n\n      (b)   Investment Representation.

Wildform acknowledges that an             investment in the Payment Shares represents a high degree of risk\n\n            and that there is no assurance that Buyer's business or operations             will be successful. Wildform has considered carefully the risks             attendant to an investment in the Payment Shares and acknowledges             that, as a consequence of such risks, such Wildform could lose its             entire investment in the Payment Shares. Wildform acknowledges that,             at a reasonable time prior to the Effective Date, Buyer furnished to             it the information specified in paragraph (b)2(ii)(A) or (B) of, and             in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)             of, Rule 502 promulgated under Exchange Act.\n\n      (c)   Restricted Securities.

Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available. Wildform further understands that, except as provided in             the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Buyer has no             obligation to register the sale of the Payment Shares or take any             other action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Act. Wildform             further understands that applicable state securities laws may impose             additional constraints upon the sale of securities\n\n      6.3 No Warranty.

The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of all information, documents and materials disclosed and statements made in connection with any negotiations or arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration proceeding and the judgment, including any hearing or award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits.

Nothing herein shall preclude any party from seeking damages or other remedies at law or in equity (other than termination of this IP Agreement or any license to any Intellectual Property granted under this IP Agreement) for any breach hereof.\n\nSection 4.3 Termination of Agreement. This IP Agreement will terminate automatically and without need for further action by either party in the event that the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\n\nSection 4.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this IP Agreement pursuant to Section 4.3, this IP Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties under this IP Agreement, including any obligation to make any assignment or grant any license hereunder, automatically end without any liability against any party or its Affiliates, except as otherwise provided in the Acquisition Agreement and except that the provisions of this Section 4.4, Article V, Section 6.1, Section 6.2, Section 6.6, Section 6.7, Section 6.8, Section 6.9, Section 6.10, Section 6.11, Section 6.12, and Section 6.13 will remain in force and survive any termination of this IP Agreement.\n\nSection 4.5 Bankruptcy. The parties acknowledge and agree that the licenses granted hereunder are licenses of \"intellectual property\" within the meaning of Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code (\"Section 365(n)\"), which have been licensed hereunder in a contemporaneous exchange for value. The parties further acknowledge and agree that if the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), as applicable (the \"Insolvent Party\"): (i) becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due; (ii) applies for or consents to the appointment of a trustee, receiver or other custodian for it, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) commences, or has commenced against it, any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or other case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or liquidation proceedings; or (iv) elects to reject, or a trustee on behalf of it elects to reject, this IP Agreement or any agreement supplementary hereto, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (\"Section 365\"), or if this IP Agreement or any agreement supplementary hereto is deemed to be rejected pursuant to Section 365 for any reason, this IP Agreement, and any agreement supplementary hereto, shall be governed by Section 365(n) and the other party may elect to fully exercise its rights under this IP Agreement in accordance with Section 365(n). Upon written request from such other party to the Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, or the bankruptcy trustee, of such other party's election to proceed under Section 365(n), such Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, such bankruptcy trustee, or any third party agent shall comply in all respects with Section 365(n), including providing such other party (and its Affiliates) with the Intellectual Property licensed to such other party (and its Affiliates) and not interfering with the rights of such other party (and such Affiliates) as provided in this IP Agreement to obtain access to such Intellectual Property from such Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, the bankruptcy trustee, or any third party agent.   33\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V CONFIDENTIALITY\n\nEach party shall (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates to) hold the Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information licensed to any of them under this IP Agreement in confidence, and shall protect the confidentiality thereof using at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own similar confidentiality or proprietary information, but in no event using less than a reasonable degree of care. Each party shall not (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates not to) (i) disclose any such Source Code, trade secrets, or confidential information to any Person other than to (a) those of its employees who have a \"need to know,\" or (b) other third Persons (including customers, suppliers, prospective suppliers, or joint developers), or (ii) use or disclose such Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this IP Agreement in accordance with any applicable restrictions or obligations with respect thereto, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), under written Contracts (which include confidentiality, use, and disclosure restrictions) normally used by such party to protect its own similar confidential or proprietary information (and in no event less stringent than the terms and conditions of this Article V). This Article V will not apply to Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information of a party or any other member of its Group or any of its Affiliates where the other party can demonstrate such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information (A) is or becomes generally known to the public or enters the public domain, other than as a result of a breach of this IP Agreement by such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates, (B) was rightfully disclosed to such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates by a third Person provided that such other party or member complies with the restrictions imposed by the third Person, or (C) was developed independently by such other party or member or Affiliate without use of or reference to any information disclosed to any of them by such party. If a party or any of members of its Group or its Affiliates is legally required to disclose any of the other party's Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information in connection with any legal proceeding, such party shall promptly notify the other party of the foregoing so that the other party may seek to prevent such disclosure or obtain the entry of a protective order or other appropriate protective device or procedure. The disclosing party shall fully cooperate with and aid such other party in connection with the foregoing. If a protective order or other protective device satisfactory to such other party is not obtained, the disclosing party or its applicable member will disclose only that portion of such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information that is legally required to be disclosed (and will notify the other party of which portions are disclosed). Each party shall take steps reasonable under the circumstances to protect the confidentiality of all Source Code, trade secrets, and other confidential information licensed under this IP Agreement by it or its Affiliates to the other party or a member of its Group or any of its Affiliates.   34\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VI GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSection 6.1 Remedies. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this IP Agreement, including the representations and warranties and covenants herein, shall be as set forth in Article 8 of the Acquisition Agreement. The representations and warranties and covenants contained herein shall terminate in accordance with Section 8.4 of the Acquisition Agreement\n\nSection 6.2 Assignment. Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization. If a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Party to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Licensed IP is bound by the license grants set forth herein. If Purchaser or a Purchaser Assignee assigns or transfers any Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), the Purchaser shall (or shall cause the applicable Purchaser Assignee to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Intellectual Property is bound by such license grants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this IP Agreement, Article III may only be assigned by a party (and shall be assigned by a party) together with such party's assignment of the Acquisition Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the foregoing limitations, this IP Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\nSection 6.3 Effect of Merger or Change of Control. Upon a merger or change of control of a party (including, for purposes of this Section 6.3, with respect to Purchaser any Purchaser Licensee and with respect to Seller any Seller Party) (a \"Change of Control Event\") with or to a Person (other than a Person that is a then-current Affiliate of such party) (the \"Buyer\"), the license rights granted under Article II to such party shall not extend to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event or any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party remains a separate, independent legal entity (or is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall continue in full force and effect. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party is merged into the Buyer (other than if the Buyer is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event) or another Person (other than if such Person is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or if such Person is a then-   35\n\n\n\n\n\ncurrent Affiliate of such party) or otherwise does not remain a separate, independent legal entity (except if such party is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then (i) the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall be limited to the operation of the business and the products, systems, and services (including Smart Sensing Network Equipment and Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices, as applicable) of such party existing as of the effective date of the Change of Control Event and Derivative Works and natural evolutions thereof (but, in all cases, with respect to such license rights, subject to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(e), as applicable), and (ii) no rights or licenses granted to such party under Article II may be extended to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event in connection with any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services.\n\nSection 6.4 Acquisitions. If either party acquires a business or a Person that conducts a business covering any of the same products, systems, or services as those covered by any license granted under Article II to such acquiring party (a \"Future Acquisition\") (whether in an asset or equity transaction), any such license shall be deemed to apply to such same products, systems, and services (but no other products, systems or services) of such acquired business or Person; provided, that all Patents acquired in connection with such Future Acquisition are licensed to the non-acquiring party and, in the case of Seller, the Seller Parties or, in the case of Purchaser, the Purchaser Licensees, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this IP Agreement. In such event, any such acquired Person shall be deemed a Seller Party or a Purchaser Licensee hereunder, as the case may be.\n\nSection 6.5 Further Assurances. Each of the parties agrees that from time to time, at the reasonable request and expense of the other party, it shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably request to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this IP Agreement (including any short form documentation evidencing the licenses granted by any Seller Party hereunder or other documentation to perfect or record the rights granted hereunder in the Transferred IP or Licensed IP in any jurisdiction throughout the world). The Seller acknowledges and agrees (including on behalf of the other Seller Parties) that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may record and perfect this IP Agreement or such documentation in any jurisdiction throughout the world, and the Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) cooperate therewith, at the Purchaser's expense. The Purchaser hereby requests, and the Seller hereby grants (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to grant) to the Purchaser and its Affiliates, all rights necessary to record this IP Agreement or such documentation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, and any equivalent office or agency in any jurisdiction in the world. Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties) to, between the Effective Date and the Initial Closing Date, cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser's preparation for acquiring the Business, including (i) by reasonably sharing information to prevent any loss of any of the Seller Entities' rights to any Intellectual Property constituting Transferred IP or Licensed IP, and (ii) facilitating between the parties and their respective Affiliates' communication and sharing of information related to this IP Agreement.   36\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.6 Governing Law; Forum.\n\n(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of conflicts of law) shall govern the construction, interpretation and other matters arising out of or in connection with this IP Agreement and its schedules (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise).\n\n(b) Except with respect to (i) the result arising out of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and (ii) the result of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) and any arbitration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) (other than to enforce any arbitral judgment), the parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware over any Dispute arising out of or relating to this IP Agreements or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby or entered into in connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS IP AGREEMENT OR THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.\n\nSection 6.7 Severability. If any term or provision of this IP Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of this IP Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions of this IP Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this IP Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.\n\nSection 6.8 Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions. This IP Agreement, together with the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the parties in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the parties' agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters contained in this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements are superseded by this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including, but subject to Section 5.5(b) of the Acquisition Agreement, the NDA. In the event of any conflict between any specific provision of this IP Agreement (including Article V) and the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, the provisions of this IP Agreement will control.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.9 Counterparts. The parties may execute this IP Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This IP Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the other party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email transmission which includes a copy of the sending party's signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.\n\nSection 6.10 Amendment. The parties may amend this IP Agreement only by a written agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to this IP Agreement.\n\nSection 6.11 Waiver. The parties may waive a provision of this IP Agreement only by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the party's favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent that the party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.\n\nSection 6.12 Notices. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this IP Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (i) when received if delivered personally; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile (with transmission confirmed); (iii) the day after it is sent if sent by commercial overnight courier; (iv) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (v) when transmitted if sent by email (with receipt confirmed by recipient).

Each party shall         indicate in all product, service, publicity and printed materials         relating to the Corio Services or the Software and MarketSite.net         Service that such trademarks are the property of the originating party.

All representations of the other         party's Trademarks that a party intends to use shall be exact copies of         those used by the other party and shall first be submitted to the         originating party for approval of design, color and other details, which         consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. To ensure         trademark quality, each party shall fully comply with all written         guidelines provided by the other party concerning the use of the         originating party's Trademarks.

Each party represents and warrants to the other party that         it is under no current obligation or restriction, nor will it knowingly         assume any such obligation or restriction that does or would in any way         interfere or conflict with, or that does or would present a conflict of         interest concerning the performance to be rendered hereunder or the         rights and licenses granted herein.\n\n7.2     Intellectual Property Warranty. Commerce One represents and warrants to         Corio that (a) Commerce One is the sole and exclusive owner of the         Software; (b) Commerce One has full and sufficient right, title and         authority to grant the rights and/or licenses granted to Corio under         this Agreement; (c) the Software does not contain any materials         developed by a third party used by Commerce One except pursuant to a         license agreement; and (d) the Software does not infringe any patent,         copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights         of a third party.\n\n7.3     Product Warranty. Commerce One warrants that the Software and         MarketSite.net Service will perform in substantial accordance with the         Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed will         be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for         a period of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, but in no event not         later than December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\").

If during the Warranty Period the         Software and MarketSite.net Service does not perform in substantial         compliance with the Documentation, Commerce One shall take all         commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software and         MarketSite.net Service, or if correction of the Software and         MarketSite.net Service is reasonably not possible, replace such Software         and MarketSite.net Service free of charge. Commerce One will replace any         defective media returned to Commerce One during the Warranty Period. In         the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably corrected at         Commerce One's sole expense, Corio has the right to terminate this         Agreement and receive a refund of all prepaid fees.

The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.\n\n7.4     Product Warranty - Year 2000 Compliance. Commerce One warrants that the         Software and MarketSite.net Service, when used in accordance with its         associated documentation, is in all material respects capable upon         installation of accurately processing, providing and/or receiving date         data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,         including the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations; provided         that all licensee and third party equipment, systems, hardware, software         and firmware used in combination with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service properly exchange date data with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service\n\n                                     8\n\n9         OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF         MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8       INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1     By Commerce One. Commerce One shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless         Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Corio or its         Customers arising out of any claim that the Software infringes any         patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party;         provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies Commerce One in         writing of any such claim and promptly tenders the control and the         defense and settlement of any such claim to Commerce One at Commerce         One's expense and with Commerce One's choice of counsel. Corio or its         Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense,         in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join         in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the         Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject         of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that         the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and         expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to         use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other         suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software         becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after         Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid         hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9         REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n                                     9\n\n10         LIABILITY RELATES.

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date         and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of         five (5) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for         subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other         party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the         expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal         thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2    Termination. If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the         termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7,         8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. Corio's right to allow its then-existing Customers         and their Software Users to use and access the Software in accordance         with Section 2 of this Agreement and all payment obligations related         thereto shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.         Commerce One's obligation to provide Software support and maintenance to         Corio and its Customers shall survive any termination or expiration of         this Agreement, provided Corio continues to make its annual support and         maintenance payments as specified in this Agreement. Upon termination or         expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise return or         destroy any Confidential Information of the other party provided,         however, Corio may retain any Confidential Information necessary for         Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers.\n\n12      SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1    Escrow Account. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce         One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce         One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW AGENT\"). The         Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n                                    10\n\n11         escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar         materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a         minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio         shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain         such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2         of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code         to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source         Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of         this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those         purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that         one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and         that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow         account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the         normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of         its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this         Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt         of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in         writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers         of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business         days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10)         business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the         matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in         Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to         Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,         nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use         and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until         the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License         Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified         shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use,         reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with         respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense         the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this         Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in         and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide         in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has         occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One         under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One operations personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].         These Commerce One operations personnel shall work together with Corio         personnel to optimize the architecture and performance of the Software         and MarketSite.net Service in a hosted environment. Commerce One shall         only commit personnel with expertise in installations, operating         environments and networking functionality.\n\n13.2    Consulting. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One consulting personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].

Commerce One may, in its sole but         reasonable discretion, elect to assign resources from a third party         systems integrator subject to advance notification to Corio of such         election.\n\n13.3    Engineering. Commerce One shall provide Corio with reasonable access to         Commerce One engineering personnel at no additional cost to Corio. Joint         engineering work may include product development, including without         limitation, technical and functional application development and         integration.\n\n13.4    Other. All services provided hereunder, in addition to services         subsequently requested by Corio (e.g. customization of the Software)         shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the         parties.\n\n13.5    Ownership. Subject to Commerce One's pre-existing ownership of any         materials or technology provided to Corio, the results of all such         development efforts set forth in this Section 13, including all         intellectual property rights in any software interface coding or         programs created solely by Corio during the term of this Agreement to         enable the Software to operated within the Corio Servers' hosted         environment (\"DEVELOPMENTS\"), shall be owned by Corio, unless such         Developments are supported on an ongoing basis by Commerce One in which         case Commerce One will retain all ownership rights, including\n\n\n\n\n\n     intellectual property rights in the Developments. To the extent that         Commerce One would otherwise have a claim of ownership in such         Developments, Commerce One hereby assigns all rights in and to such         Developments to Corio. Further, Commerce One represents and warrants         that all Commerce One employees, agents, contractors or consultants that         will be provided to work together with Corio have or will have signed         agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions         and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Corio         covenants and warrants that it will not disclose to Commerce One or its         officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors or consultants any         proprietary information, including without limitation any technical         information related to Developments created solely by Corio under this         Agreement, except upon the written authorization to do so by a Corporate         Officer of Commerce One. Commerce One covenants that during the term of         this Agreement, it will continue to require all Commerce One employees,         agents, contractors or consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention         Agreement and that Commerce One will furnish to Corio copies of such         signed agreements upon Corio's request. Ownership of intellectual         property rights to any enhancements, modifications or derivative works         to the Software itself which may be developed jointly by the parties or         solely by Corio shall be negotiated by the parties prior to the start of         any such development work.\n\n13.6    Independent Development: Covenant not to Sue. Nothing in this Agreement         will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently         develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that         it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its         officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties'         licensees, customers, or distributors (\"Protected Entities\") for patent         infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to         said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that         Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the         Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work         based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is         binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the         benefit of any\n\n                                    12\n\n13         of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce         One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any         of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or         obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without         the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the         foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in         connection with the merger or acquisition of such party or the sale of         all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement without         such consent, except in the case where such transaction involves a         direct competitor of the other party where consent of the other party         will be required. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and         inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and         permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1         shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any         provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and         signed by the party to be charged. No failure or delay by either party         in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except         as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such         right, power or remedy.\n\n14.3    Choice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by         the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws         provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts         for the International Sale of Goods.

The arbitration shall be conducted by         one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San         Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered         in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without         limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing         party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American         Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for         the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of         its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices.

Notice shall be sent to the parties at the         addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or at such other         address as shall be specified by either party to the other in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5    Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\n14.6    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of         competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be         changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n                                    13\n\n14         objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by         law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full         force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure.

Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace.

In addition, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with a monthly forecast, no later than the third                   business day of each month, of the number of Cards to be sold                   to its clients, (\"Sold Card Forecast\") as well as the number                   of Cards to be stocked in inventory, (\"Card Inventory                   Forecast\"), (collectively referred to as the \"Forecasts\") for                   the month, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Forecast and Sold Card                   Forecast in August for the month of November. The Forecasts                   will be relied on, (\"Locked\") at the time they are reported.\n\nh.       Changes to the Forecasts within the Locked period are                   expected. However, any changes to Locked Forecasts will not                   impact any applicable penalties as detailed below in                   subsections (i) and (j). AEIS will place reliance on the                   Forecasts provided by Schoolpop to align resources and ensure                   adequate production, fulfillment and customer service                   capabilities. Schoolpop shall provide AEIS with any changes to                   the Locked Forecasts on a monthly basis including any                   respective changes to either Forecast for the remaining twelve                   (12) month period.\n\ni.       In any consecutive three (3) month period in which the                   difference between the Card Inventory Forecast less the actual                   Card Order volume for that period is a shortage of ten percent                   or greater (10%+), AEIS reserves the right to assess a                   penalty, (\"Card Inventory Penalty\") of sixteen and one-half                   cents ($0.165) per Card for such difference as detailed in                   Examples 1 and 2 below.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            EXAMPLE 1            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------                            FORECAST PERIOD       ACTUAL VOLUME      FORECASTED VOLUME  DIFFERENCE            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                MONTH 1         10/1/04-10/31/04      8,000              10,000             (2,000) 20%            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------            MONTH 2         11/1/04-11/30/04      8,500              10,000             (1,500) 15%            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------            MONTH 3         12/01/04-12/31/04     8750               10,000             (1,250) 12.5%            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------            PENALTY                                                 4,750 X $0.165 = $783.75            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            EXAMPLE 2            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------                                                                                     MONTH 1         12/1/04-12/31/04      10,500            11,000              (500) 4.5%            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------            MONTH 2         1/1/05-1/31/05        10,000            13,000              (3,000) 23%            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------            MONTH 3         02/01/05-02/28/05     12,000            12,500              (500) 4%            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------            PENALTY                                                 NO PENALTY            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------\n\nj.       In any given month where the difference between the Sold Card                   Forecast less the actual Card activation volume, (\"Cards in                   Force\") is a shortage of ten percent or greater (10%+), AEIS                   reserves the right to assess a penalty, the (\"Customer Service                   Penalty\") which shall be calculated by converting Cards in                   Force into call volume minutes as follows:\n\ni.       Cards in Force times the call to card ratio times the                            average handle time equals the total call volume                            minutes. AEIS will calculate the respective product's                            average year-to-date call to Card ratio and the                            average year-to-date handle time monthly to calculate                            the call volume minutes. For purposes of example, the                            year-to-date through August 2004, Encompass(R) Select                            average call to Card ratio is 2.43 and the average                            handle time is 4.0 minutes.\n\n&sbsp;      ii.      Actual call volume minutes under 90% of the Card Sold                            Forecast will be charged at 90% of Locked Rolling                            Forecast at the standard rate of $0.50 per minute.                            Schoolpop's Customer Service Penalty shall be                            calculated at the difference between actual call                            volume minutes and 90% of Card Sold Forecast call                            volume minutes.\n\niii.

Schoolpop shall pay AEIS all incurred penalties within thirty                   (30) days of receipt of invoice for such penalties by AEIS.\n\nm.       At any given time during this Agreement, Schoolpop's inactive                   Card inventory shall be limited to $3,000,000 in Card value as                   determined by the Point denomination on each Card. This limit                 &sbsp; shall consist of a maximum Card value of $1,500,000 in                   Encompass(R) Select Cards and $1,500,000 Card value in any                   other product (s). Effective January 1, 2005, after which                   Encompass(R) Select shall no longer be available to Schoolpop,                   the maximum inactive Card value shall not exceed $3,000,000 in                   any combination of products at any given time.

CARD ISSUANCE\n\na.       Schoolpop agrees that it will review all requests for each                   Program requested by the Client and will use reasonable and                   customary business practices to qualify and recommend Clients                   proposed for a Program. Schoolpop shall take commercially                   reasonable efforts to ensure all information requested for a                   Client is true, accurate and correct.\n\nb.       AEIS may, from time to time, provide Schoolpop with                   commercially reasonable qualification standards for Clients.                   Schoolpop shall not knowingly submit an Order to AEIS on                   behalf of any Client that does not meet any such standards.                   Schoolpop agrees that it will sell Cards only to Clients and                   only for use in connection with a bona fide fund raising                   program. Schoolpop will not knowingly sell Cards to any Client                   who does not meet any AEIS qualification standard(s) or to any\n\n3\n\nClient or potential Client that Schoolpop has reason to believe would          be unsatisfactory to AEIS.\n\nc.       AEIS reserves the right at any time, with or without cause,                   with reasonable written notice to Schoolpop, to cancel or                   decline any Client's participation in the Program.\n\nd.       AEIS may, at its sole discretion, decline to provide Cards to                   Clients.\n\ne.       Cards are intended for use in the United States and must be                   designated for receipt of shipment within the United States.\n\nf.       AEIS' designated vendor will be responsible for shipping Cards                   in accordance with Schoolpop's instructions.\n\ng.       AEIS's designated vendor will ship the Cards as follows:\n\ni.       During Period One, AEIS' designated vendor will use                            reasonable commercial efforts to ship the Cards as                            detailed below, following receipt and clearance by                            AEIS of Card Funding.\n\nii.

One point is worth one (1) U.S. Dollar ($1.00 USD) (\"Point\").\n\ni.       AEIS shall ship Cards in bulk shipment via its designated                   vendor to Schoolpop, F.O.B. Atlanta, Georgia. Schoolpop shall                   distribute to each Cardholder the Cardholder agreement as                   provided with each Card and which includes instructions on                   \"How to Use the Card\". Should Schoolpop or its Client                   distribute Cards without such Cardholder agreement, Schoolpop                   shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS, its parents,                   subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers,                   directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss,                   hereinafter defined, that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as                   a result of such action, including, without limitation, any                   claims brought by any entity including but not limited to                   governmental entities and Cardholders.\n\nj.       Purchases made with a Card having insufficient Points will be                   deemed a deniable transaction. The correct way to handle the                   purchase is described in the Cardholder agreement. If there is                   a purchase made on a Card where there are insufficient Points                   on the Card, the negative amount will be the responsibility of                   the person whose signature appears on the Card, as described                   in the Cardholder agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nk.       CARDS LOST OR STOLEN IN TRANSIT IN THE INITIAL SHIPMENT FROM                   AEIS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AEIS. The full risk of loss                   for ordered Cards shall pass to Schoolpop immediately upon                   their delivery to Schoolpop by AEIS and AEIS shall not                   reimburse Schoolpop or Client for any delivered Card that is                   lost, stolen, misappropriated, or that otherwise disappears or                   is fraudulently or inappropriately used (together referred to                   as \"Loss\"). Schoolpop shall remain solely liable for any Loss                   caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of its                   employees, agents or representatives after the shipment has                   been received by Schoolpop. AEIS will not reimburse Schoolpop                   or its Client or be responsible for any Loss in connection                   with or after delivery of Cards to Schoolpop, its Clients or                   the Cardholder whether they are shipped to Schoolpop, its                   Client, or to either of their pre-designated delivery agents.                   Only Cardholders are eligible to receive replacements from                   AEIS and replacements are given only in accordance with the                   agreement between the Cardholder and AEIS. Cards are usually                   shipped in packaging with AEIS' designated vendor as the                   return address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEIS shall bear                   no risk of Loss and of non-receipt of Cards by the intended                   Cardholder in the event that AEIS is instructed to use another                   address as the return address, the address provided to AEIS                   for Schoolpop or the Client was incorrect, the request for the                   Card was unauthorized, and/or any information received by AEIS                   with regard to the processing of the Order was fraudulent or                   incorrect.\n\nl.       All agreements entered into between Schoolpop and its Clients,                   shall contain a provision substantially similar to the                   preceding Section 3 (k).\n\n4\n\nm.       During the term hereof, Schoolpop shall maintain at all times                   the following information with respect to Card resale and                   distribution to Client:\n\ni.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,                   Confidential Information shall not include (d) information                   that is publicly known, already known by, or in the possession                   of the non-disclosing party, or (e) is independently developed                   by the non-disclosing party without use or reference to the                   other party's Confidential Information, or (f) is rightly\n\n9\n\nobtained by the non-disclosing party from a source other than                   the disclosing party without such restrictions.\n\nd.

If any such employee, affiliate,                   agent, subcontractor or professional advisor discloses or uses                   the Confidential Information in a manner not permitted under                   this Agreement, the party disclosing the Confidential                   Information to such employee, affiliate, agent, subcontractor                   or professional advisor will be liable therefore. If either                   party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information,                   it may be disclosed, provided that, unless prohibited,                   sufficient prior notice is given to the non-disclosing party                   to afford it an opportunity to take whatever steps it deems                   necessary to protect the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information. In the event a party is required to                   disclose the other party's Confidential Information in                   connection with any judicial proceeding or government                   investigation, a notification of such requirement shall                   promptly occur allowing a reasonable time for the appropriate                   party to seek a protective Order from the appropriate court or                   government agency. Thereafter, Confidential Information may be                   disclosed to the extent required by law, subject to any                   applicable protective Order.\n\ne.       Upon request of the other party, each party will promptly\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn to the other any or all Confidential Information of the                   other then in its possession or under its control provided,                   however, that each party may retain one copy of all such                   Confidential Information solely for its own internal records,                   such Confidential Information to remain subject to the                   restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement\n\nf.

Such Cards must be completely destroyed by                   cremating or shredding to the point where such Cards cannot be                   reconstructed in any way or Card numbers cannot be read in any                   way. Such destruction must be evidenced by execution of AEIS'                   Destruction Certificate, which is attached hereto as Schedule                   II. The Destruction Certificate shall be executed by Seller                   through two authorized signatures and shall particularly                   describe the Cards by (1) Card product name, (2) Card number,                   (3) denomination, (4) shipment tracking number, and (5)                   quantity by product and denomination, and account number.                   Seller shall pay AEIS associated destruction fees for such                   Card destruction as detailed within the Destruction                   Certificate.

In no event shall Seller throw away                   discard expired or spoiled or otherwise unwanted Cards in any                   other manner than described in this Section 2(n).

This                   Agreement shall be terminated by AEIS at AEIS' choice                   immediately upon Seller receiving a non-passing status of such                   security audit.

No other employees of AEIS have authority to modify or waive any term          of this Agreement. This Agreement may be assigned by AEIS to any          parent, subsidiary, affiliated or associate corporation without          Seller's consent and shall, whether or not so assigned, inure to the          benefit of any AEIS parent, subsidiary, associate or affiliate thereof          which pays or becomes liable upon any Cards delivered to Seller under          this Agreement.\n\n4.       This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by either party          by notice given in accordance with paragraph 8, below and in accordance          with Section 14(h) of the Agreement.\n\na.

This includes ALL advertising, promotional and marketing materials in any medium (INCLUDING: COMMUNICATIONS, ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTION COLLATERAL, DIRECT MAIL, PRESS RELEASES, VIDEOS, WEB SITES, PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, SALES PRESENTATIONS AND SIMILAR MATERIALS.) Copy and layout should be submitted as early as possible. Due to the type of communications piece, approval could take anywhere from 3 to 10 business days.\n\nMERCHANT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR APPROVAL GUIDELINES\n\nConsumer applications are typically more involved. Generally, consumer programs are targeted to a wider audience; therefore, the implications are greater for the merchant. For this reason, the merchants mandate that AEIS seek individual approvals from each and every merchant.\n\nAny standard applications using customized collateral should be reviewed by AEIS for content and accuracy. Even in the cases where standard program materials are to be used, AEIS will need to internally review any customized announcements and/or teasers. More than likely, these pieces feature only merchant names or merchant lists in print and can typically be approved within 24-48 hours.\n\nPieces using only select groups of merchants, photos or logos will generally require a higher level of approval and depending on the merchants used, may require approval from the merchant as well. The approval timeline will range from three to ten (3-10) business days for existing/ongoing.\n\nOnce, layout and copy are approved by AEIS Communications Group, Merchant Partnerships, Operations and American Express, any ongoing and additional changes must also be approved.\n\nIMAGES, LOGOS, PRODUCT PATENT, AND REGISTERED/SERVICE MARKS\n\nIMAGES AND LOGOS The following are examples of merchant image and logo usage, which require merchant approval through Merchant Partnerships:\n\no        Any communication or collateral, whether standard or customized,          containing merchant images or logos must be reviewed by Merchant          Partnerships o        Any new design work of merchant logos and images not previously          approved o        Use of standard merchant logos in any color other than the original          color o        Unique positioning of merchant images - surrounding merchants, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\no        \"Direct mail\" pieces, which include merchant references when only          \"select\" merchants are referenced. o        Unusual type of creative print work such as posters o        Borders around logos and busy backgrounds o        Any copy or tag-lines not previously approved o        Under no circumstances are press release photos to be used on or in          association with any form of communication relating to incentive card          programs unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        Images and/or logos are not to be altered (cropped, inset, or overlaid)          unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        All images used in magazine format must be obtain merchant copy write          information next to the image\n\nMERCHANT PARTNERSHIPS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REMOVE IMAGES AT ANY TIME          THAT MAY BE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF THE MERCHANT (THIS          INCLUDES OUTDATED OR SEASONAL IMAGES AND LOGOS).\n\nALL QUESTIONS REGARDING MERCHANT COMMUNICATION APPROVAL SHOULD BE          SUBMITTED TO ANN FINK AT ANN.FINK@AEIS.COM, 636-226-2043.\n\n27\n\nEXHIBIT 5\n\nCATEGORY CARD TARGET

To the extent working with Agents or other Third Parties is permitted under the R&D Work   Plan, should a Party wish to engage an Agent or any other Third Party in connection with the R&D Work Plan or any other work   under this Agreement, such Party must obtain in advance a written agreement by such Agent or other Third Party (i) to assign to   the Party all Inventions conceived, created or generated by the Agent or other Third Party, and (ii) to maintain all Confidential   Information in confidence as set forth in Section 5.2.

Each Deliverable shall be deemed to be completed once such   Deliverable has been Accepted (as defined below).   3.2 Free from Infringement. Without the consent of Stryker, Conformis shall not introduce any structure or   methodology in the Deliverables (including a Deliverable within a Product or a Stryker Product) that (1) raise a colorable   argument of patent infringement in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of the Deliverable as such Deliverable   8   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nis intended to be exploited under the Other Agreements, (2) misappropriate any Confidential Information of any Third Party, or   (3) otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party. For clarity, disclosure of a matter on the Disclosure   Schedules to the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed consent by Stryker under this Section 3.2.   3.3 Completion. After a Deliverable has been furnished to Stryker, Stryker (or its Agent designee) will be entitled to   analyze and test the Deliverable to determine if it operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable   Acceptance Criteria set forth in R&D Work Plan. Conformis shall provide such assistance as Stryker may reasonably request in   such determination. Stryker shall have [**] (\"Acceptance Notification Period\") following the date the Deliverable is received by   Stryker to Accept or reject the Deliverable as described in Section 3.4.   3.4 Acceptance or Rejection. Respecting any Deliverable for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2, as set forth below, if   Stryker determines that a Deliverable operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria   pursuant to the R&D Work Plan, then Stryker will notify Conformis in writing that Stryker Accepts such Deliverable. If Stryker   reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not operate in accordance with or otherwise conform to the applicable Acceptance   Criteria, then Stryker will provide Conformis with a written notice of rejection within the Acceptance Notification Period   describing the defect in view of the relevant Acceptance Criteria and including sufficient detail with respect to such Stryker testing   and testing results as Conformis reasonably requests (\"Failure Notice\"). Conformis shall have [**] (or such longer period of time   as may be agreed between the parties in good faith should the scope and complexity of the applicable Deliverable warrant some   longer period of time) (\"Redelivery Period\") following the date it receives the Failure Notice to correct and redeliver the   Deliverable. If Conformis timely delivers a corrected version of the Deliverable within the Redelivery Period, then Stryker will be   9   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nentitled to repeat its acceptance analysis and testing process for the purposes of determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D   Work Plan until such Deliverable operates in accordance with or otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria;   provided, however, that if Stryker properly rejects a particular Deliverable three (3) or more times in accordance with this Article   III, or if Conformis fails to deliver a version or corrected version, as the case may be, of the Deliverable within any respective [**]   period, Stryker may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2(c) (in the event of such three (3) rejections, Stryker   \"Finally Rejects\" the Deliverable). Such termination, together with the provisions of Section 5.2 of the License Agreement,   constitutes as Stryker's sole remedy and Conformis' exclusive liability in the event of any such rejection or failure by Conformis to   deliver materially conforming Deliverables hereunder so long as such rejection or failure does not arise from Conformis' fraud,   willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. Stryker shall be deemed to have accepted a Deliverable timely furnished to it   unless (a) the Deliverable fails to operate in accordance with and otherwise conform the applicable Acceptance Criteria, and (b)   Stryker provides Conformis a written Failure Notice within the Acceptance Notification Period in accordance with this Section   3.4 (any acceptance or deemed acceptance, described in this Section 3.4, \"Acceptance\" or \"Accept\"). Acceptance of a   Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Stryker may have based on Conformis' warranties set forth in this   Agreement.   3.5 Payment for Milestones. Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development   work to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:   (a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-   Specific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a   total of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and   10   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific   Instrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three   million U.S dollars ($3,000,000).   3.6 Payment. Stryker shall make all payments to Conformis required herein by wire transfer in accordance with the Wire   Instructions. Such payments are non-refundable and non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements.   ARTICLE IV   RESTRICTIVE COVENANT   4.1 Exclusivity. Except as specifically provided in the Distribution Agreement, Conformis shall be prohibited from   developing or assisting another in developing, or causing another to develop, Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf   Knee Implants for any Third Party in the field of orthopedics until January 1, 2032 (or earlier, to the extent set forth in Section   2.3.3.4 or Section 2.3.5 of the Distribution Agreement), with the exception that Conformis (including any entity involved in a   Change of Control of Conformis, any such entity an \"Acquirer\"), may develop Patient-Specific Instrumentation for any Off-The-   Shelf Implants of Conformis, an Acquirer or any of their Affiliates. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing does not prevent   Conformis from granting any license, release, covenant not to sue or other immunity to any third party under any Patents, including   any such immunity that would authorize manufacture, use or sale of Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf Knee   Implants outside the Buyer Field.   ARTICLE V   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   5.1 Inventions.   (a) Inventorship of all Inventions developed by either Party, or both Parties, in the performance of the R&D Program, shall   be determined in accordance with the inventorship laws of the United States, even to the extent such Invention is not pursued in   patent applications.

Conformis agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to Stryker all right, title and interest in and to all Improved Stryker Background IP in which ownership   in same has vested in   11   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nConformis by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or consultants; and to facilitate such assignment to Stryker,   Conformis agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make any appropriate assignments to it of that   which constitutes Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) at Stryker's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees   and consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation necessary to perfect title in Stryker of such   Improved Stryker Background IP.   (c) All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (\"Joint IP\") shall be   owned jointly by the Parties. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Joint IP may be used freely by either Party or   its Affiliates and licensed to Third Parties by Conformis and its Affiliates, on the one hand, outside of the Buyer Field or by Stryker   and its Affiliates, on the other hand, within the Buyer Field, in each case, without the consent of, or duty to account to or notify, the   other Party, but, except with respect to external licenses of the Improved Conformis Background IP by Conformis or its Affiliates   to Third Parties, any external Third Party license shall be governed in accordance with the last sentence of Section 4.3(c) of the   APA. Each Party to whom ownership is to vest in Joint IP by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or Agents agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to the other Party an undivided one-half right, title and interest in and to all Joint IP; and to facilitate   such assignment, the Party possessing such ownership agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make   any appropriate assignments to it; and (ii) at the other Party's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees and   consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation to perfect the undivided one-half right, title and   interest in and to the other Party of such Joint IP.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing does not constitute either (1) the grant by Conformis to Stryker   of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, regardless of   the extent to which the Joint IP constitutes improvements to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, (2) the   grant by Stryker to Conformis of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Stryker Background IP, or (3) the grant   by either Party of any license or immunity of any kind under any Intellectual Property rights owned by such Party, regardless of   whether the exploitation of the Joint IP would infringe such Intellectual Property rights. Neither Party shall assign a partial interest in   12   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nthe Joint IP or Joint IP Rights to any Affiliate or Third Party (i.e., neither Party shall create any additional joint owners of the Joint   IP), but each Party may assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Joint IP and Joint IP Rights to an Affiliate or Third Party   pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.2.   (e) Conformis shall promptly disclose to Stryker all (i) Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) Joint IP. Stryker shall   promptly disclose to Conformis all Joint IP.   (f) To the extent required and for the avoidance of doubt, Stryker hereby grants Conformis, and Conformis hereby   accepts, a non-exclusive license to the Stryker Background IP and Improved Stryker Background IP solely for purposes of   performing any obligations under this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement.   5.2 Confidential Information.

AND               AMERICAN GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF DELAWARE\n\nThis Unconditional Capital Maintenance Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), is made, entered into and effective as of March 30, 2011, by and between American International Group, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (\"AIG\"), and American General Life Insurance Company of Delaware, a corporation organized under the laws of the Delaware (the \"Company\").\n\n                                  WITNESSETH:\n\n   WHEREAS, the Company is a life insurer subject to certain capital requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of Delaware (the \"Domiciliary State\");\n\n   WHEREAS, the Company is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AIG; and\n\n   WHEREAS, AIG has an interest in unconditionally maintaining and enhancing the Company's financial condition:\n\n   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n    1. In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the        Company's first and third fiscal quarters (as determined based on the        Company's first and third fiscal quarterly filed statutory financial        statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications        thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the        Company's independent auditors) falls below the Specified Minimum        Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action Level RBC (in each        case as estimated by the Company as of the end of each such first and        third fiscal quarters, as the case may be), AIG shall, within the        respective time periods set forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with        paragraph 5 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the        Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments that        qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's        Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an        amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of        each of the\n\n       Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be        projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of        the Company's Company Action Level RBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing,        AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in        compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in        such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to        equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be        appropriate by the Company and AIG.\n\n    2. In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital (a) for each of        the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarters (as determined        based on the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarterly filed        statutory financial statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments        or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance        department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess of the        Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action        Level RBC (in each case as estimated by the Company as of the end of        each such first, second and third fiscal quarters, as the case may be)        or (b) as of each fiscal year end (as shown in the Company's fiscal        year-end filed statutory financial statements, together with any        adjustments or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's        insurance department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess        of the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action        Level RBC (as shown in such fiscal year-end statutory financial        statements), the Company shall, within the respective time periods set        forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with paragraph 5 and subject to        approval by the Company's board of directors as required by the laws of        the Domiciliary State, declare and pay dividends ratably to its equity        holders in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount        necessary to reduce the Company's projected or actual Total Adjusted        Capital as of each of the end of the Company's fiscal quarter or fiscal        year, as the case may be, to a level equal to or not materially greater        than the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action        Level RBC or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by the Domiciliary        State's law to be paid as an ordinary dividend less an amount that the        Company and AIG agree is appropriate to protect the Company from        exceeding such maximum amount allowed by such Domiciliary State's law as        a result of potential audit adjustments or adjustments to the        projections on which such dividend amount is based. For the avoidance of        doubt, this paragraph shall only require the Company to pay ordinary        dividends; under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay        any dividend which would trigger the\n\n       extraordinary dividend provisions of Section 18 (S) 5005 (B) of the\n\n\n\n\n\n       Insurance Law of the Domiciliary State or that is otherwise prohibited        by the Domiciliary State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement        does not prohibit the payment of extraordinary dividends to reduce the        Company's projected or actual Total Adjusted Capital to a level equal to        or not materially greater than the Specified Minimum Percentage of the        Company's Company Action Level RBC.\n\n    3. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\", \"Company        Action Level RBC\", and \"Surplus to Policyholders\" shall have the        meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of        the Domiciliary State, or, with respect to \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and        \"Company Action Level RBC\", if not defined therein, shall have the        meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions        promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners        (\"NAIC\"). The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the        percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be        agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon        the date of the filing of the Company's 2010 Annual Statement with the        Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against        the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each        of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service        (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the        obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum        Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and        revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the        parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material        changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of        S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the        Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,        which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that        under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or        instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is        treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,        and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any        other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which        AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum        Percentage then in effect.\n\n    4. The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under        paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per        year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business        day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal\n\n                                      3\n\n       quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business        day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and        (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing        of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements        and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's        fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with        applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1        may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year        of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory        financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year,        respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as        capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet        to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may        be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting        Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State. The        Company and AIG further agree that any dividends to be made under        paragraph 2 will take place as soon as practicable after the filing by        the Company of the relevant fiscal quarter-end or fiscal year-end        statutory financial statements or such earlier time as may be agreed by        the Company and AIG.\n\n    5. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees        that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct        parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds,        securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or        (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any        capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject        in either case to any required regulatory approvals. At any time any        dividends are due under paragraph 4, the Company agrees that it will        make such dividend to the Company's direct parent and will use its best        efforts to cause such direct parent to then dividend or otherwise        provide such funds to AIG. All contributions and dividends contemplated        under this Agreement shall be approved, declared and made, as        applicable, in compliance with applicable law, including, without        limitation, approval by the board of directors of each applicable entity        (including the Company) and any prior notice requirements specified        under applicable rules and regulations of the Domiciliary State.\n\n    6. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the        extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management,        relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance        regulator, the Company hereby acknowledges that, in a manner consistent        with past practice and\n\n       any other reasonable requirements of AIG, it will comply with all        financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing,        corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural\n\n\n\n\n\n       requirements set forth by AIG.\n\n    7. AIG hereby waives any failure or delay on the part of the Company in        asserting or enforcing any of its rights or in making any claims or        demands hereunder.\n\n    8. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with this paragraph 8, this        Agreement shall continue indefinitely. AIG shall have the absolute right        to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice        to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of        termination (the \"Termination Date\"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AIG agrees        not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies        the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells        the Company to an acquirer (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P,        Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to        the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the        Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such        agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale        by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with        the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of        S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal        to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date        immediately preceding such sale. To the extent not terminated previously        by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate        automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by        AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect.        For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant        to this paragraph 8 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it        may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains        outstanding as of, the Termination Date.\n\n    9. Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the        termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the        Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this        Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to        enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other        payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may        proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under        paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n\n                                      5\n\n       Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no policyholder of the Company may        take any action authorized under this paragraph 9 unless and until        (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to        enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 9,        which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis        for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with        this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and,        PROVIDED, FURTHER, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance        with paragraph 8 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for        under this paragraph 9 shall terminate effective as of the Termination        Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make        capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 4 and 5        of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to,        and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being        understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after        the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against        the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 9).\n\n    10.This Agreement is not, and nothing herein contained and nothing done        pursuant hereto by AIG shall constitute or be construed or deemed to        constitute, an evidence of indebtedness or an obligation or liability of        AIG as guarantor, endorser, surety or otherwise in respect of any        obligation, indebtedness or liability, of any kind whatsoever, of the        Company. This Agreement does not provide, and is not intended to be        construed or deemed to provide, any policyholder of the Company with        recourse to or against any of the assets of AIG.\n\n    11.Any notice, instruction, request, consent, demand or other communication        required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be        given or made or communicated by United States first class mail,        addressed as follows:\n\n       If to AIG:\n\n          American International Group, Inc.           180 Maiden Lane           New York, New York 10038           Attention: Secretary\n\n       If to the Company:\n\n          American General Life Insurance Company of Delaware           c/o SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.           2727-A Allen Parkway\n\n          Houston, Texas 77019           Attention: Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n       with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\n          American General Life Insurance Company of Delaware           c/o SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.           1999 Avenue of the Stars           Los Angeles, CA 90067           Attention: General Counsel\n\n    12.On April 24, 2011, this Agreement shall supersede and replace that        certain letter agreement, dated December 13, 1991, by and between AIG        and the Company regarding capital maintenance without the need for any        action.\n\n    13.The covenants, representations, warranties and agreements herein set        forth shall be mutually binding upon and inure to the mutual benefit of        AIG and its successors and the Company and its successors.\n\n    14.This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the        laws of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of        laws.\n\n    15.If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared null, void or        unenforceable in whole or in part by any court, arbitrator or        governmental agency, said provision shall survive to the extent it is        not so declared and all the other provisions of this Agreement shall        remain in full force and effect unless, in each case, such declaration        shall serve to deprive any of the parties hereto of the fundamental        benefits of or rights under this Agreement.\n\n    16.This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties        hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all        prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and        discussion, whether oral or written, of the parties.

The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that all information, whether oral or written,  concerning a disclosing party and its business operations, prospects and strategy, which is furnished by the disclosing party to the other party is  deemed to be confidential, restricted and proprietary to the disclosing party (the \"Proprietary Information\"). Proprietary Information supplied shall  not be disclosed, used or reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of, and in accordance with the terms of, this  Agreement and the Indenture.

Unless otherwise specified in writing, all Proprietary Information shall (i) remain the property of the disclosing party, (ii) be  used by the receiving party only for the purpose for which it was intended under this Agreement and the Indenture, and (iii) together with all  copies of such information, be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed upon request of the disclosing party, and, in any event, upon  termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided or contemplated by this Agreement, including Sections 3.02(b) and (e) and 8.05  hereof.

Because damages may be difficult to ascertain, and without limiting any other rights and remedies  specified herein, an injunction may be sought against the party who has breached or threatened to breach this Section.

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs. (b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.

Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges that it shall have no right under this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to become due and owing) to the other Party, whether under this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or otherwise, against any other amount owed (or to become due and owing) to it by the other Party. 3.

Any Party (the \"Non-Breaching Party\") may terminate this Agreement with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the other Party (the \"Breaching Party\"), if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.6) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of 30 days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such service. For the avoidance of doubt, non-payment by Recipient for a Service provided by Provider in accordance with this Agreement and not the subject of a good-faith dispute shall be deemed a breach for purposes of this Section 3.3. 3.4 Insolvency.

If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services.

Once a notice to terminate has been validly given, the Affected Services will terminate on the termination date set out in the notice. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other in respect of termination of the Affected Services due to Force Majeure, but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Confidentiality. 4.1 Confidentiality.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information. 4.2 Return of Confidential Information. Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party's option, all Confidential Information received in connection with this Agreement. If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction in writing. 5. Indemnification. 5.1 Indemnification.

The Parties hereby irrevocably submit any disputes under this Agreement to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel-Aviv, Israel, provided however, that Recipient shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other appropriate remedy against Provider in the country in which Provider has acted in breach of the terms hereof. 7.4 Specific Performance.

Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid or unenforceable provisions. 7.7 Construction.

MBRK will pay DD an Up-Front Payment of $50,000 upon execution of this Agreement.\n\n5.2. Additionally, MBRK shall pay a Deposit to DD equal to $100,000 upon the Promotion Commencement Date. Each  month the Parties will review the amount of the Deposit and where necessary MBRK will make an additional deposit  payment to DD in order to maintain a total Deposit with DD of at least two (2) times the current month's Promotion  Fees. For example, if in a month Promotion Fees are $105,000, then MBRK will increase the Deposit to two (2) times  $105,000, equal to $210,000. The Parties agree to meet via conference call within five (5) business days of the end of  each month to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be  increased, within ten (10) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to  DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit. Notwithstanding the above, if during years 2 and 3 of this Agreement,  in the event MBRK's then current annual form 10-K filed with the SEC does not contain an audit opinion that expresses  doubt about MBRK's ability to continue as a going concern, then MBRK's requirement to maintain a Deposit is waived.  In all cases the Deposit amount will be used to settle any outstanding amounts due to DD by MBRK at the end of the  Agreement or at the time the Deposit requirement is waived.\n\n5.3. Additionally, on or before the last day of each month, DD will invoice MBRK for the Promotion Fees due for the prior  month. Such Promotion Fees shall be calculated by:\n\n(a) the following formula for the period from the Effective Date through September 30, 2010:\n\nFor example: if during the month of March 2010 (a) (A) above was 2,000 TRx and (B) above was $36.50 then MBRK  would be remit $36,500.00 to DD.\n\nOR\n\n(b) the following formula for the period from October 1, 2010 through termination of this Agreement:\n\n  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per TRx multiplied by:      (C)   50%.\n\n  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx Tablets for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per Tablet multiplied by:      (C)   50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example: if during the month of November 2010:\n\nMBRK would remit $89,425.00 to DD:\n\nThese Promotion Fees represent fair market value payment for such services rendered.\n\nThe Parties recognize that Promotion Fees are to be settled on a monthly basis which requires the use of an estimated  Gross Margin Per Tablet amount until the actual Gross Margin Per Tablet for an applicable quarter can be determined.  Accordingly, to facilitate the calculation and settlement of monthly Promotion Fees for periods after September 2010,  the Parties agree that the Gross Margin Per Tablet used to settle the monthly Promotion Fees will be that as calculated  using the previous calendar quarter's Gross Margin Per Tablet data and current period's Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx. Such Promotion Fees for the three months in any calendar quarter will be subject to a true-up process  which will occur by the 15th of the second month of the following quarter. By way of example, Promotion Fees for each  of the months of April, May and June will be settled using the Gross Margin Per Tablet amount that has been calculated  for the quarter ended March 31 and will be subject to a true-up process to occur by August 15 with any adjustment to  such Promotion Fees being settled between the parties within 15 days thereafter.\n\n5.4 In the event MBRK shall discontinue detailing prescribers in a territory that is not included in the then current DD  Target Segment Prescribers set forth in EXHIBIT 1 to this Agreement or any amendments thereto (\"New DD Target  Segment Prescribers\"), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the Promotion Fee payable to DD should MBRK desire  that DD add those New DD Target Segment Prescribers to the DD Target Segment Prescribers.\n\n5.5. The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by  MBRK.\n\n5. 6. The basis for determining the Promotion Fees will be the Prescriber Data provided by MBRK to DD.\n\n5.7. DD agrees to submit invoices to MBRK at the following address:\n\nAttn: Accounts Payable  MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  7 Village Circle, Suite 100  Westlake, TX 76262\n\n  (A)=  Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx (5,000) x an average tablet amount for the month of (9.8 tablets)=  49,000      (B)=  3.65      (C)=  50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6 \u2014 Obligations of MBRK\n\n6.1. Subject to the terms of confidentiality set forth in Section 10, MBRK agrees to make available to DD to the best of  its ability the items as stipulated in EXHIBIT 2. These items include the relevant portions of its marketing and  communications plan, approved sales promotion materials in electronic format where available, sales and training aids  relevant to MOXATAG and promotional items and packages for appropriate licensed physicians, nurses, nurse  practitioners and physician assistants.

The meters calibration factor shall be effective only after the date of the last calibration and the  parties participating in the calibration shall issue a certificate; otherwise this shall be documented in a letter from the Transporter to the Senders.     13.3.7 Pursuant to API recommendations, testers shall be re-calibrated at least once every five years (from the date of the last calibration) o  immediately after any alteration in the measuring section.\n\n\n\n  24\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.8 The Hydrocarbon volumes that the Transporter accepts and schedules for its Transportation shall be determined by meters installed in the  nodes of Entrance and/or Exit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transporter may use alternate methods included in the API standards. If the  static measurement of tanks is used, these must have their measurement approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy or the competent entity.  The tank measurement shall be determined following the current existing standards for such purpose.     CLAUSE 14 VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY     14.1 The Regulations of Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as annex 1 (MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION  OF QUALITY FOR THE MIX OF CRUDE OILS).     14.2 Each of the Senders shall deliver to the Transporter at a Point of Entrance a Hydrocarbon volume which, and only for purposes of Volumetric  Compensation for Quality (CVC), shall be valued according to the procedure defined for the Pipeline and in accordance with its particular quality.  This quality shall be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the  Sender.     14.3 Considering that as a result of the Transportation the Hydrocarbons delivered in the Pipeline are mixed without distinction, each Sender shall  withdraw at the Point of Exit a volume of Hydrocarbons with a different quality than its Hydrocarbon delivered, except when it has been requested  and has been accepted the Transportation of Hydrocarbons in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated Hydrocarbon shall also be  determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the Senders. This  Hydrocarbon shall be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation for Quality and shall take into account the compensation for  quality due to the interfaces occurring when transported with other Crude Oils.     14.4 The Transporter shall apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality defined by the same for the Pipeline which shall have the  following main characteristics:     14.4.1 The Senders who have delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a better quality than the mixed Hydrocarbon withdrawn at the Point  of Exit of the Pipeline shall be entitled to compensation in volume, equivalent to the volumes that Senders who have delivered Hydrocarbons of  lower quality than the ones withdrawn at the Point of Exit will have to assume. For such purpose, individual qualities of all volumes delivered and  withdrawn shall be taken into account as well as the final inventories of the preceding month of Operation and the last month of Operation, with its  respective qualities.\n\n\n\n  25\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    14.4.2 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be internal between the Senders in such a way that the final volumetric balances equal cero  and the Transporter shall neither charge nor Pay any volume for this purpose and shall only serve as a mediator, regulator, liquidator and  responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations.     14.4.3 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Rate and therefore shall not be compensated or will have any variation as a result  of this.     14.5 In each month of Operation the Transporter shall make a balance of the existing volumes and qualities at the beginning of the month delivered  to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn and existing at the end of the month, both for the total of Hydrocarbons as well as for individual Hydrocarbons of  each Sender.     14.6 The Sender shall hold the Transporter and owner harmless against any cost, action, claim, intended procedures by any Third parties, losses  and all damage and obligations incurred and inherent to the mix of Hydrocarbons in the Transportation process and the Volumetric Compensation  for Quality.     14.7 In any case the Transporter may modify the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality contained herein, in the respective annexes  and all other documents in connection with the CVC.     14.8 Senders of a specific Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter not to apply the Volumetric Compensation for Quality to said  Hydrocarbon. The foregoing shall be applicable as long as the Hydrocarbon of other Senders is not affected negatively.     14.9 By agreement between the totality of Senders and the Transporter, it may be decided not to implement the Volumetric Compensation for  Quality (CVC) for Crude Oils transported through the system. In this case the Transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the  Senders to carry out the volumetric balances.     CLAUSE 15 BULLETIN OF TRANSORTATION BY THE PIPELINE - BTO     15.1 The Transporter shall implement the Bulletin of Transportation by the Pipeline - BTO - which shall contain as a minimum the following  information:     15.2 Information of public access:     15.2.1 General description of the Pipeline     15.2.2 Current rates for each Distance     15.2.3 Value tables or current calculation formulas of Monetary Conditions     15.2.4 Design Capacity of the Pipeline and Nominal Capacity\n\n\n\n  26\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.2.5 Monthly available Capacity of the Pipeline estimated for the next (6) months and annual for the next five (5) years.     15.2.6 Excerpts of this Manual corresponding to connection requests, nomination process and minimum quality requirements of Crude Oil     15.3 Information of exclusive access for Senders and Third parties:     15.3.1 This valid Manual.     15.3.2 Discussion on modifications to the Manual     15.3.3 General information on the programmed maintenance schedule of the Pipeline and other programed activities affecting the effective Capacity  during the next six (6) months.     15.3.4 Listing of expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline's infrastructure     15.3.5 Effective Capacity confirmed for each month of Operation and estimated for the following five (5) months and the corresponding available  Capacity for each Distance.     15.3.6 Transportation program for the month of Operation and tentative for the following (5) months for each Distance     15.3.7 Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and foreseen in the nomination process to assign the available Capacity  equitably     15.3.8 Last volumetric balance prepared for the Pipeline.     15.3.9 Daily statistics for the last month of Operation and monthly statistics since the enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the Ministry  of Mines and Energy on the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances.     15.3.10 The annual rates and the Monetary Conditions for each Distance from the date of enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the  Ministry of Mines and Energy.     15.4 The Transporter is no obliged to publish any information of reserved character.     15.5 The Transporter shall provide to Senders and any Third parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline as requested,  within the following ten (10) calendar days after the request and with previous verification from the Transporter of their Capacity as Sender or  Third Party an access password to the information of exclusive character referred to in numeral 15.3 of this clause. The access with a password  shall be active while the requestor maintains its Capacity as Sender or Third Party.\n\n\n\n  27\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.6 The Transporter shall communicate any updates, amendments or additions of relevant information in the BTO by means of electronic mail or  direct communication to the Office of Hydrocarbons of the Ministry of Mines and Energy and to all those with active access to the information of  exclusive character pursuant to the previous numeral.     CLAUSE 16 SPECIAL TRANSPORTATION CONDITIONS     16.1 The Transportation of Hydrocarbons shall be subject to the following conditions:     16.1.1 The Hydrocarbon shall be delivered by the Sender at a Point of Entrance and withdrawn at a Point of Exit.     16.1.2 The Transportation of Hydrocarbon shall be subject to performance of the conditions foreseen in the Transportation Contract, the Manual  hereof, its modifications, additions or updates, including its annexes and the applicable regulations.     16.1.3 The Transporter reserves the right to receive or reject a Hydrocarbon that fails to meet the minimum specified values; in case of reception,  the Sender shall Pay the Transporter any costs incurred in the analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required  specifications or to implement the scheme required for its Transportation.     16.1.4 The Transporter reserves the right to require, reject or approve the injection at any other Point in the Pipeline of products such as corrosion  inhibitors, depressors of Point of fluidity, friction reducers or any other additive in the Hydrocarbon to be transported.

The Sender shall Pay the Transporter all costs incurred in the  analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required specifications or to implement the scheme required for its  Transportation.     16.1.6 The Transporter shall be entitled, with a previous provisional notice, to remove and sell the Crude of any Sender that fails to comply with  any of the specifications at its Sole discretion. If the Transporter exercises its right of sale pursuant to this clause, the Transporter shall deduct  from the proceeds of such sale all costs incurred by the Transporter with respect to the storage, removal and sale of such Crude Oil. The  Transporter shall pay the balance to the Sender.\n\n\n\n  28\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    16.1.7 The Transporter shall not accept Crude Oil delivered by any Sender if this may cause impairment to the Pipeline of the Crudes or mixtures  transported (without consideration of whether or not the Crude Oil meets the minimum quality specifications).     16.1.8 The Transporter acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be entitled to make any changes to the minimum quality specifications of Crude  Oil in accordance with operating practices, which may be necessary or pertinent, including but without being limited to, prevent material damage or  the material degradation of the effective Capacity of the Pipeline in order to prevent any personal injuries or damage to the property or the  environment.     CLAUSE 17 REGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON     17.1 With a previous request from the Sender or Third Party, the Transporter may accept the Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon to the  extent that this is a technical and economically viable alternative. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme set  out in clause 10 and shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions in this Manual.     17.2 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter shall inform the Sender its disposition to start the Transportation of segregated  Hydrocarbon. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be subject to the nomination process set forth in this Manual.     17.3 Any additional charges for Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be borne by the Sender or Third Party requesting the service, and  it will be taken into account, including but without being limited, any costs and damage caused to the Transporter, owner or other Senders.     CLAUSE 18 RISKS AND RESPONSIBILITY     18.1 The Transporter shall exercise custody on the Hydrocarbon from the time the Sender or whoever the Sender designates, delivers it at the Point  of Entrance and until the Point of Exit.     18.2 Neither the Transporter nor the owner shall be responsible for the consequences of failing to comply with the deliveries and withdrawals  generated by the Sender in the Transportation program, commitments of operators and/or Transporters of Transportation systems connected to  the Pipeline.\n\n\n\n  29\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.3 The Transporter shall not be responsible for any damage or deterioration that a Hydrocarbon delivered by a Sender may suffer, such as  contamination with strange materials, contamination by contact of different types of Hydrocarbons if the damage or deterioration is due to  Justified Events. In the event any of the cases previously mentioned occurs, and one or more Senders are involved, all the Hydrocarbons affected  shall be prorated between the Senders in proportion to the ownership of each of the Hydrocarbons involved, without prejudice of any indemnities  afterwards which may be applicable between the Senders affected. The Transporter shall prepare the information corresponding to the volume of  Hydrocarbon affected and the proportion corresponding to each Sender.     18.4 The Transporter shall be responsible for the Transportation service, for any losses, damage or deterioration that the Hydrocarbon may suffer.  The Transporter shall be released from any responsibility in the Justified Events and the Transporter is not incurring in any gross negligence.     18.5 Any damage or prejudice caused to the Transporter by virtue of failing to comply with the regulations contained in this Manual by any  Sender shall be the responsibility of the Sender who shall indemnify the Transporter for such damage or prejudice.     18.6 Hydrocarbons delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in their quality as a result of the mix with other  Hydrocarbons. Except for events in which segregated Hydrocarbons are transported, the Transporter shall not have any obligation to return at the  Point of Exit a Hydrocarbon of the same quality as the Hydrocarbon delivered for its Transportation at the Point of Entrance. The adjustments of  Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be applied to the transported mixed Hydrocarbons.     18.7 In the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline, contamination fronts are generated. All Senders  of the Pipeline shall accept as withdrawn volume, a portion of the contamination fronts generated in the Transportation through the Pipeline. If the  Sender requires some special conditions for the Transportation of a Hydrocarbon, these shall be agreed with the Transporter who reserves the  right to accept them and require the Sender to bear all costs associated to such conditions.     18.8 The following shall be considered in the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline:     18.8.1 The Hydrocarbon of higher quality with respect to the Hydrocarbon of lower quality shall always be degraded in the contamination fronts.\n\n\n\n  30\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.8.2 The Transporter shall estimate a maximum volume corresponding to the contamination fronts and shall be responsible to comply with this  value.     18.9 The Transporter is obliged to return the Sender and the latter to withdraw at a Point of Exit, the volume of equivalent Hydrocarbon upon  application of the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     18.10 The Senders and Third parties shall indemnify and hold the Transporter and the owner harmless against any costs, claims, litigations, judicial  or extra-judicial action, and decisions of any kind, which may be brought against the Transporter or owner, and in general by any procedure  intended by any Third parties.     CLAUSE 19 FILLING THE PIPELINE OR FILLING THE LINE     19.1 It is the necessary volume to fill the Pipeline between the initial pumping station and the final station, the non-pumping bottom of the storage  tanks of the Pipeline, and all installations, tubes, equipment, pumping and measuring accessories.     19.2 For the Pipeline Operation, the Transporter may request to each Sender, including the ANH, to deliver to the Transporter the necessary  quantity of Hydrocarbon to fill in the line of the Pipeline. The participation of each Sender in filling in the line shall be determined by the  Transporter based on criteria such as: Ownership of the Pipeline and Contracted Capacity.     19.3 The Transporter shall determine at its judgment the Day in which each Sender shall deliver its proportional participation in filling the line of  the Pipeline, and shall communicate the corresponding volume indicating the date of delivery.     19.4 The Hydrocarbon delivered by the Senders to fill in the line of the Pipeline shall not be withdrawn from the Pipeline without the previous  authorization from the Transporter. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall not lose the ownership of the Hydrocarbon remaining in  the Pipeline.     19.5 When segregated Hydrocarbon is transported, it shall be understood that the ownership of the filling of the line of the Pipeline varies  according to the volumes of segregated Hydrocarbon present in the Pipeline at a given time. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall  not lose the ownership of the segregated Hydrocarbon remaining in the Pipeline.     CLAUSE 20 HANDLING LOSSES IN THE PIPELINE     20.1 The identification and handling of losses in the Pipeline shall be carried out as follows:\n\n\n\n  31\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.1 All identifiable losses of mix or segregated Hydrocarbon not attributable to the Transporter as per numeral 18.4 shall be assumed by the  Senders of the mix or segregated Hydrocarbon according to the calculation made by the Transporter based on the Operational parameters and  formalized in the CVC. In this sense, the Senders accept the liquidation made by the Transporter.     20.1.2 The report prepared by the Transporter shall be considered as the basis to calculate the identifiable losses, indicating the Operation  conditions of that day, time, place, causes, deliveries, dispatches, withdrawals, mix or segregated Hydrocarbon, recovered and lost and determined  after the filling of the line and the restarting of the pumping.     20.1.3 Non-identifiable loses are understood only those losses during Transportation to which its cause cannot be determined with precision  throughout the process, from the Points of Entrance to the Points of Exit, including but without being limited to the following:\n\n   20.1.4 The Transporter shall calculate these losses each semester in such a manner that the semester calculation reflects the real losses occurring  during each semester. The average semester of all losses shall be up to cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries of the period. This  calculation shall be made by means of balances that the Transporter shall carry out at the beginning of each calendar month with respect to the  previous calendar month, which shall reflect the deliveries and withdrawals, the inventory movement and the identifiable losses, if there are any, to  be calculated each semester.     20.1.5 In the case of mix Hydrocarbon, the Non-identifiable Losses of the semester shall be assumed by each of the Senders at prorate of the  deliveries of the period.\n\n\n\n  \u00b7 Stops/ starts of the Pipeline    \u00b7 Illegal extractions non-detected    \u00b7 Faults in the meter factors    \u00b7 Volumetric contractions    \u00b7 Leakages/passes in the valves    \u00b7 Evaporation    \u00b7 Escapes    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties on the measurement systems and associated instrumentation    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties of laboratory analysis associated to the calculation of volumes    \u00b7 Propagation of inherent uncertainties of the procedures set out at the international level for the calculation of volumes by static and  dynamic measurement.    \u00b7 Handling loses inherent to the Pipeline\n\n  32\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.6 In the case of segregated Hydrocarbon, the Sender of the segregated Hydrocarbon shall assume the Non-identifiable losses of the semester.     20.1.7 In the event that Non-identifiable losses exceed cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries, calculated each semester, the Transporter  shall inquire on the possible causes in order to take the corrective actions immediately.     20.1.8 The calculation procedure of losses in the Pipeline shall be governed by the provisions in this clause and the current Compensation  Mechanism for Quality for the Mix of Crude Oil.     20.1.9 Non-identifiable losses equal or less than 0.5% monthly shall be distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each  Sender of the calendar month in which they were detected or the calendar month in which they are reported.     20.1.10 Identifiable losses are distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each Sender on the calendar month in which they  were detected     CLAUSE 21 CLAIMS     21.1 Any claim by a Sender or Third Party in connection with the Transportation service of Hydrocarbons shall be resolved pursuant to the  internal procedures of the Transporter and the applicable regulations. These claims shall be delivered to the Transporter's Operational area and  they shall conduct the respective internal procedure and shall communicate the result to the Sender.     21.2 For claims regarding the quantity or quality of Hydrocarbons, these shall be presented in writing at the latest within fifteen (15) calendar days  after the date of delivery or withdrawal of the Hydrocarbon or the date in which the report for the Volumetric Compensation for Quality is issued.  The claim shall be justified within the following thirty calendar days after being presented.     21.3 If the Sender does not present its claim, or if made extemporaneously, or if it is not duly and timely justified, it shall mean the acceptance by  the Sender of the Hydrocarbon delivered or withdrawn or the Volumetric Compensation by Quality, as the case may be.     CLAUSE 22 SANCTIONS TO OPERATING AGENTS FOR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULE     22.1 Each of the nominations made by Senders and Third parties shall constitute their commitment to comply with the delivery and withdrawal  schedule with quantities and flow rates previously agreed between the parties.\n\n\n\n  33\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    22.2 For the Operation of the Pipeline the following particular provisions shall be taken into account to apply the following sanctions depending  on the type of Sender:     22.2.1 Sender with Contracted Capacity in Firm:     22.2.1 If by any reason the delivery is less than 95% or more than 105% of their Scheduled Capacity, the Sender shall Pay:     22.2.1.1.1 The Transportation fee for volumes delivered when they are higher than the Contracted Capacity in firm. When they are equal or less the  Sender shall Pay Transportation fee on the Contracted Capacity in firm.     22.2.1.1.2 The Transporter may decide to charge the Sender a sanction equivalent to 5% of the Transportation Fee of the Scheduled Capacity.\n\n\n\n   22.2.1.2 If by any reason, delivery is between 95% and up to 105% of its scheduled Capacity, the Transporter shall charge the Transportation fee  for volumes delivered when these are above the Contracted Capacity in firm.

The purpose of the CVC is to establish a system to compensate Senders for the degradation or improvement of the Crude Oil withdrawn  compared with the Crude delivered. The Sender withdrawing a Crude o lower quality than the Crude delivered shall be compensated  with a higher volume. The Sender withdrawing a Crude with higher quality than the Crude delivered shall compensate others Senders of  better quality accepting a lower volume. At any rate, the sum of debits and credits by CVC for all Senders shall be cero.\n\n\n\n  1. LOSSES\n\n  2. CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION\n\n  3. VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY - CVC\n\n  3.1 When Crude Oils are delivered to the Pipeline of different quality and from different Senders, the result shall be a Crude Oil with  different characteristics of quality and market value than the Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline by each of the Senders. Due to different  qualities of Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline, some Senders shall withdraw Crude of higher value than the Oil delivered while others  shall withdraw Crude Oil with less value than the Oil delivered to the Pipeline.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    At any node of Entrance of the Pipeline where two or more Crude Oil flows merge in order to be transported, a volumetric compensation  for quality shall be established on the resulting mix.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions in the Manual of the Transporter shall be applied for measurements in the  Pipeline.\n\n   The Transporter set out detailed procedures for the CVC following the guidelines established hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   For any month of Operation the corresponding quantity of Crude of each Sender shall be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.2 SAMPLING AND SYSTEM MEASUREMENT\n\n  3.3 CVC PROCEDURES\n\n  3.3.1 The Transporter shall administer the CVC process and the Senders may audit the process or request reviews thereto as long as the  Transporter is timely informed and a working plan is coordinated between the parties.\n\n  3.3.2 The Transporter shall establish monthly the coefficients for adjustments of quality and sulfur pursuant to the criteria established  herein.\n\n  3.3.3 The CVC shall be settled in kind.\n\n  3.3.4 The Transporter shall make monthly adjustments to the corresponding volume of Crude to each Sender, based on the coefficients of  adjustment for quality.\n\n  (a) Reduced if such Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of lower quality than the average quality of the mix,\n\n  (b) Increased if said Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of ah higher quality than the average quality of the mix.\n\n  3.3.5 At the latest on the 15th day of the calendar month following the Operation, Senders shall report to the Transporter the export prices,  the API gravity and the sulfur content of its Crude for the Month of Operation.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The parties may jointly review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The API gravity and the sulfur content on the data base of the Crude quality are representative of the current qualities of Crude  which is being delivered.     The variability of the API gravity and sulfur is within an allowed tolerance to be determined by the parties. Analyses of sulfur  content shall be conducted based on a schedule agreed by the parties after the beginning of the Fiscal Year.\n\n   By means of using the Crude Oil basket of reference the variation of price shall be determined regarding the API grade and sulfur content for Crude  Oil delivered. The method is based on the use of the linear regression of prices of a Crude Oil basket of reference delivered in the coast of the Gulf  of The United States of America with API gravity and sulfur content.\n\n\n\n  3.3.6 Each month of Operation the Transporter shall measure the volumes delivered by the Senders and shall determine the weighted  average for the quality parameters of Crude Oils delivered.\n\n  3.3.7 The Transporter shall calculate the adjustments to the volume for each Sender and shall determine the Crude volume that  corresponds. No adjustment in the volume as a consequence of the CVC shall affect the Transportation fee that a Sender shall Pay to  the Transporter.\n\n  3.3.8 Senders acknowledge that adjustments to their Crude volumes to be withdrawn as a result of these principles and procedures of the  CVC may affect the volume of Crude Oil for a withdrawal afterwards.\n\n  3.3.9 Senders are entitled to review the Transporter's calculations regarding the adjustments by CVC and the due application of this  procedure.\n\n  (a) The appropriateness of the Crude Oil reference basket regarding their terms of quality.\n\n  (b) The information on prices available to the public.\n\n  (c) The calculations of the coefficients and the volumes adjusted.\n\n  3.3.10 A data base for the API gravity shall be developed and sulfur content for Crude delivered from reliable samples of laboratory of  Crude Oil flows. The quality data of Crude Oil must comply with the following criteria:\n\n  3.4 METHODOLOGY FOR CRUDE OIL VALUATION\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n   The basket of Crude Oil to be used shall always include a minimum of ten (10) Crude Oils. The basket of reference for Crude Oil with prices and  qualities historically recognized shall be used to determine the coefficients of adjustment for API grade and sulfur content. The price information  of the basket shall be continuously available from sources open to the public for each Crude Oil of reference. Prices reported used in the basket of  Crude Oil of reference shall be obtained from independent price information services recognized by the industry and shall come from real  Operations.     This basket provides a range of qualities to develop the coefficients for the regressions and therefore cover the flows that may be injected to the  Pipeline. The initial basket of Crude Oils to be used is the one established in table I of this procedure which may be reviewed by common  agreement between the Transporter and the Senders.\n\n   All price quotes of Crude Oil for a common location in the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America shall be adjusted.     All prices of Crude Oil of reference shall be adjusted with respect to the location and based on the availability of price information according to the  following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tables II to IV of this procedure show examples for calculation of basket Crude prices delivered in the Gulf Coast.\n\n   To determine API gravity and sulfur coefficients linear regressions shall be run using the minimum square method.\n\n\n\n  3.4.1 BASKET OF REFERENCE FOR CRUDE OIL\n\n  3.4.2 CALCULATION OF CRUDE OIL PRICES FOR THE BASKET IN THE COAST OF THE GULF\n\n  1. FOB quotation\n\n  - Transportation to the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America is added using the appropriate vessel size.\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  2. CIF quotation\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  3. Crude Oil delivered by the Pipeline\n\n  - Any Pipeline fee is added if necessary\n\n  - \"Superfund\" is included and other fees/tariffs as appropriate.\n\n  3.4.3 LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PRICES, GRAVITY AND SULFUR\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    First the arithmetic average is calculated for prices of the basket of Crude Oils of reference delivered in the Gulf coast for three months. The  cumulative average for three months shall be calculated at the closing of the settling month using the prices for the settling month and the two (2)  previous months prior to the settling month (See 1 in table V).     To determine the API gravity coefficient, a linear regression analysis shall be performed using the three months average of Crude prices from the  basket calculated in the paragraph above as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 2 in table V).     To determine the sulfur content a linear regression analysis shall be conducted using the three month average of Crude prices from the basket  calculated in the previous paragraph as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 3 in table V).     The results of the determination of the linear relation between the price delivered and the API gravity and sulfur content may be stated in the  following lineal equation:     Y = A1* X1+ B* X2 + b     Pr = A1* APIR+ B*SR + b (1)     Where:     PR = Crude price in $/Bbl     A1 = API gravity coefficient determined through linear regression in $ by grade API-Bbl     APIR = Independent variable of API gravity     B = Sulfur coefficient determined through linear regression in $/%S-Bbl (negative number)     SR = Independent variable of sulfur content     b = Y interception determined from the linear regression in $/Bbl.\n\n   After obtaining the API and sulfur coefficients, a volumetric adjustment shall be calculated to conciliate differences between the quality of each  Sender and the mix transported. The quantity to be adjusted for each Sender is determined as is follows:\n\n\n\n  3.4.3 ADJSUTMENT OF VOLUMES FOR SENDERS (TABLE VI)\n\n  44\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    The relative value of Crude Oil for each Sender shall be calculated at the Point of Entrance. To obtain this, the API gravity of Crude from each  Sender is multiplied by the API coefficient obtained in the regression and then adding to this result, the multiplication of the sulfur percentage of  Crude from each Sender by the sulfur coefficient obtained in the regression. See table VI in the column - Relative value of Crude $/BBL     The relative value of the mix transported is calculated with the data of the relative value of each Crude Oil from all Senders. This value is obtained  calculating the weighted average of the relative values of each Crude Oil multiplied by the volume delivered by the Sender. (See (1) table VI     After this, the average export price of the mix must be obtained with the data from exports of all Senders in the month in which the adjustments are  made. (See (2) in table VI     To obtain the calculated price, the difference between the relative value of each Crude Oil and the relative value calculated for mix (1) must be  obtained, and add this difference to the average export price of the mix.     Then, the quantity delivered by the Sender is multiplied by its calculated price and this product is divided between the average export price of the  mix, obtaining as a result the total adjusted volume by Sender.     The volume to be adjusted shall be the difference between the total adjusted volume by Sender and the volume delivered by a Sender to the  Pipeline.     The sum of volumes to be adjusted from all Senders must be cero.     The Transporter shall run the linear regression using a spreadsheet such as Excel. The Transporter shall document the statistical results of the  linear regression so that the information can be provided to any Sender upon request.\n\n\n\n  45\n\n\n\n\n\n  Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   Table I     Reference Crude Basket\n\n   Table II     Illegible Information     Table III     Illegible Information     Table IV     Illegible Information\n\n\n\nDegree Origin API, \u00b0 Sulfur% Source for   Pricing  BBL/MT\n\nArab Light Saudi Arabia 33.2 1.9 Argus, Formula 7.34  Arab Medium Saudi Arabia 30.5 2.4 Argus, Formula 7.22  Arab Heavy Saudi Arabia 27.6 2.8 Argus, Formula 7.09  Castilla Colombia 18.8 2.0 Platts 6.70  LLS US Gulf Coast 36.2 0.3 Argus 7.47  Mars US Gulf Coast 28.0 2.1 Argus 7.15  Maya Mexico 21.1 3.5 Argus 6.80  Napo Ecuador 18.0 2.3 Platts 6.66  East Ecuador 24.0 1.2 Platts 6.93  Vasconia Colombia 26.5 0.9 Platts 7.04\n\n  46\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    Table V     Linear regression of prices, API gravity and sulfur - August 2010 Closing Example\n\n\n\n   Table VI     Adjustments of volumes for senders - August 2010 example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  API Sulfur JUN-2010 JUL-2010 AUG-2010 Average of   3 previous   months (1)  Arab Light 33.2 1.9 77.60 76.26 76.29 76.72  Arab Medium 30.5 2.4 75.84 74.59 74.62 75.02  Arab Heavy 27.6 2.8 74.34 73.32 73.25 73.64  Castilla 18.8 2.0 69.84 69.20 69.20 69.41  LLS 36.2 0.3 78.94 78.84 79.79 79.19  Mars 28.9 2.1 74.63 74.18 74.35 74.39  Maya 21.1 3.5 66.27 67.47 68.65 67.46  Napo 18.0 2.3 69.56 69.02 69.08 69.22  East 24.0 1.2 72.12 71.93 72.15 72.07  Vasconia 26.5 0.9 74.93 75.89 75.29 75.37\n\n(2) API, $/API-BBL Coefficient 0,495      (3) Sulfur, $%S-BBL (1,191)\n\nBank of Quality Coefficients       API Coefficient (0.50)  Sulfur Coefficient (1.19)\n\nSender Volume   injected   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nAPI in   the   injection   point\n\nSulfur in   the   injection   point\n\nRelative  value of   the crude   S$/BBL\n\nCalculated   Price   $/BBL\n\nTotal   Volume   adjusted   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nVolume   to adjust   MBBL/mo\n\nSender A 900 31 0.5 14.75 77.97 935 36  Sender B 1,200 26 1.0 11.69 74.90 1,195 (2)  Sender C 600 20 2.0 7.53 70.74 566 (34)  Total 2,700         2,700 -\n\n(1) Relative value calculated for mix 11.79  (2) Average price of exportation of mix, August 2012 75.00\n\n  47\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 2: DEFINITION OF STANDARD BARRELS PER SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n  48\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS     See File Annex 3 attached.

In those cases, ECOPETROL through the vice presidency of corporate  finance and the respective manager and/or director shall inform the Promoter if the guarantee will be made effective. Furthermore, Law 1116 of 2006  did not include the provision of the foregoing paragraph, instead, in article 43 the Law regulated the issue of real estate guarantees within the  process of insolvency, and therefore the power to make them effective was suspended, save by authorization of all creditors to wave said  limitation. Said decision shall be made with an absolute majority and included within the Agreement. Thus, the creditor may present in the  proceedings, together with its debt, the guarantee covering it and a request to make it effective, or else wait the development of the proceeding,  and if terminated by breaching, the enforceability will be then \"reactivated\".\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.12 Restructuring by General Agreements.\n\n  18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Provision of services to clients with whom global payment agreements have been executed or under Law 550/99 or Law 1116/06 shall only be made  under the modality of payment in advance.

Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds\n\n\n\n\n\navailable to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.

Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.

LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.\n\n         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.\n\n5.

If the  Franchisee  does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.\n\n         Pretzel Time may, at its option, with reasonable cause and upon written notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the expiration  of the term of this  Agreement.  If  applicable  law  requires  that Pretzel Time give longer  notice to  Franchisee  prior to the  expiration of the term than is specified in the Franchise Agreement,  the Franchise Agreement will remain in effect on a  month-to-month  basis until the requisite notice has been given.\n\n         5.B.

A provision which permits alterations to the premises in a good          and workman-like manner by Franchisee as required by Pretzel Time.\n\n         Franchisee further agrees to execute and return the lease and any other riders,  guaranties or sureties  required by the Landlord  within seven (7) days from receipt of the same and no later than sixty (60) days after signing of this Agreement.  If any lease  expires  prior to the  expiration  of this  Agreement, Franchisee  will be  required to arrange  any  necessary  lease for the Unit and Pretzel Time shall have the right to approve the terms of the renewal  lease for the Unit prior to Franchisee's execution thereof. Franchisee agrees that he will not execute a lease or sublease which Pretzel Time has  disapproved.  Franchisee shall  deliver a copy of the signed  lease to Pretzel  Time for the Unit  within five (5) business days after its full execution.  The copy shall be complete and include copies of all signature pages and exhibits.\n\n         A copy of the form of the sublease  that  Franchisee  shall execute (if Pretzel Time is the tenant  pursuant to the lease) is attached hereto as Exhibit M.

Rent is generally paid monthly on the first day of the month and is  non-refundable.  Franchisee  agrees  that the Unit  shall be used  only as a Pretzel Time franchise.\n\n         If  Franchisee  fails to obtain  lawful  possession of an approved Site (through a lease or assignment) within sixty (60) days after delivery of Pretzel Time's approval of the Site, Pretzel Time, may, in its sole discretion, withdraw approval of such Site at any time.\n\n         7.C.     RELOCATION.\n\n         In the event that  Franchisee's  lease is  terminated,  with or without fault of  Franchisee,  if the Site is damaged,  condemned or otherwise  rendered unusable as a Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with this Agreement, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel Time and  Franchisee,  there is a change in the character of the location of the Site sufficiently  detrimental to his business  potential to warrant its relocation,  Pretzel Time will not unreasonably  withhold permission for  relocation  of the  Unit  to  another  Site,  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's then-current  site  criteria,  subject to the rights of  existing  Pretzel  Time franchisees  under their  franchise  agreements  with Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time is under no  obligation  to approve a relocation of the Franchise.  However,  upon written approval from Pretzel Time, Franchisee may relocate the Franchise to another  location.  Such approval shall not be granted unless  Franchisee is in compliance with all terms and conditions of this  Agreement  and  Franchisee  has the  financial  resources  available to relocate the Unit and construct a new and  comparable  Unit according to Pretzel Time's then current design  standards.  Any such  relocation of the Franchise is subject to Pretzel Time's prior  approval of the new Unit  location.  Relocation shall be at  Franchisee's  sole expense and Pretzel Time shall have the right to charge  Franchisee  for  any and all  costs  incurred  by  Pretzel  Time,  and a reasonable  fee  for  its  services,  in  connection  with  any  such  approval, evaluation  and  relocation  of the  Franchise.  The Unit  shall  re-open at the replacement  Site as soon as  reasonably  practicable  but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the closing of the original location.\n\n8.

Franchisee  shall also submit all revised or \"as built\" plans and          specifications  during the course of such  construction upon request of          Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to pay for any and all architect fees          and pay the architectural fees for the architect to review, approve and          modify the plans.\n\n         8.B.

Franchisee agrees not to open the Unit for business until the following has occurred:\n\n          (1). Pretzel  Time  approves  the  Unit  pursuant  to its  Pre-Opening                Checklist;\n\n          (2).

FRANCHISEE TRAINING.\n\n         10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  (\"Unit Manager\") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.\n\n         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise, be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation, and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.\n\n         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.\n\n         All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.\n\n         10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.\n\n         Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.\n\n         Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.\n\n         10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.\n\n         Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new\n\n\n\n\n\ntechniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.\n\n         10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.\n\n         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:                             (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures                utilized by Pretzel Time Units;\n\n          (ii) Purchasing  required  fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment,  signs,                Products, materials and supplies;\n\n          (iii) Advertising and Promotional programs;\n\n          (iv) Employee training; and\n\n          (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and                management procedures.\n\nSuch guidance shall, in Pretzel Time's  discretion,  be furnished in the form of Pretzel  Time's  Operations  Manual,  bulletins  and  other  written  materials, electronic computer messages,  telephone  conversations  and/or consultations at Pretzel Time's offices or at the Unit. Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.\n\n11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.\n\n         11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.\n\n         Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory. At its initial opening, Pretzel Time, at  Franchisee's  expense,  shall  designate  and supply an initial  quantity of forms,  literature,   display,  and  promotional  materials.  Pretzel  Time,  in consideration of the Advertising Fund Fee, shall periodically provide Franchisee with  camera  ready  advertising  materials.   Multiple  copies  of  advertising materials will be furnished to Franchisee for an additional  fee,  including any related shipping, handling and storage charges.\n\n         11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.  Pretzel  Time may  expend, disburse and use funds from the Advertising  Fund, in its sole  discretion,  for the following purposes:\n\n                  (1) The  creation  and  development  of nonlocal  advertising,          promotional campaigns,  and public relations to promote and enhance the          value of the Service  Marks and the  business  of all the Pretzel  Time          retail establishments;\n\n                  (2) Payments to Pretzel Time of such reasonable sums as may be          necessary  for actual  costs of  advertising  production,  direct  mail          purchases, and other media marketing tools;\n\n                  (3) Payment of salaries and  benefits  for staff  personnel in          the  marketing  and  public  relations  department  as  well  as  other          administrative  costs and overhead expenses of the department  incurred          by Pretzel Time;\n\n                  (4) The  costs of  employing  advertising,  marketing,  public          relations and promotion  agencies to assist in preparing and conducting          media programs and activities and supporting public  relations,  market\n\n\n\n\n\n         research and other advertising, promotion and marketing activities;\n\n                  (5) Market  research  expenditures  related to the development          and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion;          and\n\n                  (6)  Costs  of  organizing   and  providing   facilities   for          international, national, or regional franchisee conferences.\n\n         Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.\n\n         11.C.    SEGREGATION OF ADVERTISING FUND.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  herein   agrees  to   administratively   segregate   the Advertising  Fund on its books and  records.  Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.  Any monies not  expended  in the fiscal year in which they were  contributed  shall be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n                   11.D. SUSPENSION OF ADVERTISING FUND FEES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  reserves  the right to  suspend  contributions/fees  and operations of the  Advertising  Fund for one or more  periods,  and the right to terminate the  Advertising  Fund, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Franchisee.  All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.\n\n         11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.\n\n         In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.\n\n         11.F.    USE OF TRADEMARK REFERENCES AND APPROVAL                   OF FRANCHISEE'S MARKETING.\n\n         Franchisee further agrees that all advertising, promotion and marketing by Franchisee shall be completely clear and factual and not misleading and shall conform to the highest  standards of ethical  marketing and  promotion  policies which may be prescribed from time to time by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee agrees to use the  registration  symbol of \"R\" within a circle (7 ) in connection with its use of the Marks.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials. Franchisee  agrees not to use  promotional or advertising  materials  which have been  disapproved  by Pretzel Time or that have not been approved for use within the preceding twelve months.\n\n         In  addition,  any  pamphlets,  brochures,  cards or other  promotional materials  offering  free Products may only be used if prepared by Pretzel Time, unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance by Pretzel  Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Pretzel Time will give favorable consideration to Franchisee's use of free product cards developed by Franchisee, if the cards clearly state that they may only be  redeemed  at Pretzel  Time Units  owned by  Franchisee.  Franchisee agrees to list and advertise the Franchise in the regular white pages  telephone directories distributed within Franchisee's metropolitan area.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to distribute and display at Franchisee's  location, literature,  display and promotional  materials  including  special  promotional materials  as  Pretzel  Time may from  time to time make  available.  Franchisee agrees that only those advertising,  promotional  materials,  or items which are authorized  by  Pretzel  Time in  writing  prior to use  shall be used,  sold or\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributed,  and no  alternate  display or use of the Pretzel Time Service Mark shall be made without the prior written permission of Pretzel Time.  Replacement or updated literature, display,  point-of-purchase and promotional materials may be obtained from Pretzel Time for a fee including shipping.\n\n12.

Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that all manuals loaned to Franchisee contain  confidential and proprietary  material and information of Pretzel  Time  provided  to  Franchisee  is to be  used  by  Franchisee  only in connection  with the  operation of the  franchised  Unit and other  Pretzel Time Units. The Operations Manual contains trade secrets and confidential information and will  remain the  property  of Pretzel  Time and shall be  returned to it on termination of this Agreement.  Franchisee  covenants not to reveal the contents of the Operations  Manual to  unauthorized  persons.  Franchisee may not, at any time,  copy the Operations  Manual,  in whole or in part,  either  physically or electronically. In the event Franchisee's copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed or significantly damaged, Franchisee shall be obligated to obtain from Pretzel Time, at Pretzel Time's then applicable  charge,  a replacement  copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         12.C.    INCORPORATION OF OPERATIONS MANUAL INTO AGREEMENT.\n\n         The  Operations  Manual's  specifications,   standards,  and  operating procedures  communicated to Franchisee in writing shall be deemed a part of this Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.  Any  administrative  or financial  Section set forth in the  Operations  Manual shall be in addition to, and not in derogation or limitation  of, any right or remedy  granted to Pretzel Time  under  the  Franchise  Agreement,  the  Operations  Manual,  or any  other document,  or  otherwise  available  to  Pretzel  Time,  at  law  or in  equity, including,  without limitation,  the right to terminate a franchise in the event of certain defaults or delinquencies.\n\n         12.D.    MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n          Franchisee  understands  and agrees  that the  Pretzel  Time System is constantly  being  modified  and  improved,  and  that  such  modifications  and improvements  require  changes  from time to time in the  system of  operations. Franchisee  further  agrees  to  accept  and  comply  with  such  modifications, revisions,  and additions to the Pretzel Time System and Operations Manual which Pretzel Time in the good faith exercise of its judgment believes to be desirable and reasonably necessary in the time period indicated by Pretzel Time.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  Standards  may be  periodically  modified  by Pretzel  Time and that such  modifications  may  obligate  Franchisee  to invest additional capital in the Unit and/or incur higher operating costs. Pretzel Time will not obligate  Franchisee to invest  additional  capital at a time when such investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and specifications  prescribed  from  time  to  time in the  Operations  Manual,  or otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.\n\n13.      UNIT IMAGE AND OPERATION.\n\n         13.A.    CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF UNIT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees that:\n\n                  (1) neither the Unit nor the Site will be used for any purpose          other than the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit in full compliance with          this Agreement or other agreements with Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee  will maintain the condition and appearance of          the Unit, its equipment, furnishings, fixtures, and signs in accordance          with the  specifications  and standards of Pretzel Time and  consistent          with  the  image  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit  as a  first-class,  clean,          sanitary,  attractive and efficiently  operated food service  business;          and\n\n                  (3)  Franchisee  will  perform  such  maintenance  (including,          without limitation,  maintenance  procedures and routines which Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to  time)  with  respect  to  the  decor,\n\n\n\n\n\n         equipment, fixtures,  furnishings,  vehicles, and signs of the Unit and          the Site,  as may be required or directed by Pretzel  Time from time to          time to maintain such condition,  appearance,  and efficient operation,          including, without limitation:\n\n          (a)  continuous  and thorough  cleaning and sanitation of the interior                and exterior of the Unit;\n\n          (b)  thorough repainting and redecorating of the interior and exterior                of the Unit and/or the Site at reasonable intervals;\n\n          (c)  interior and exterior repair of the Unit and/or Site; and\n\n          (d)  repair or replacement of damaged, worn out or obsolete                   furnishings,  equipment,  fixtures  and signs,  provided  that                   Pretzel  Time  will not  require  Franchisee  to  replace  any                   obsolete equipment unless Pretzel Time has initiated a program                   to  replace  such  equipment  as it becomes  necessary  in its                   company-owned Pretzel Time Units; and\n\n                  (4) Franchisee  will not make any material  alterations to the          Site or to the appearance of the Unit as originally developed,  without          prior approval in writing by Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (5) Upon notice from Pretzel  Time,  Franchisee  shall remodel          and conform  Franchisee's  building design, Trade Dress, color schemes,          and  presentation  of Marks to Pretzel Time's then current public image          within a  reasonable  amount of time,  which  shall not  exceed six (6)          months.  Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to          the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as          Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program          promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall          not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or          completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement          shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received          during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by          virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.\n\n         In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:\n\n          (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,                remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or\n\n          (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.\n\n         If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.\n\n         13.B.  UNIT MENU.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.\n\n         13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.\n\n         Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.

Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such\n\nmaterials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time.

A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.\n\n         14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.\n\n         14.C.

If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.\n\n         14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n         The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.\n\n         14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.\n\n         Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.\n\n         14.F.    PAYMENT OF TAXES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall be  solely  responsible  for  payment  of all  taxes, including, but not limited to, real estate, sales, payroll,  franchise,  income, personal  property,  and gross  receipts taxes which are assessed as a result of Franchisee's operation of the Franchise.\n\n         14.G.    SALE OF PRODUCT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.\n\n         14.H.    COOPERATION.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.\n\n         14.I.    INSURANCE.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.\n\n         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.\n\n         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.\n\n         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.\n\n         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as \"suggested.\" The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.\n\n15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n\n         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time.

Franchisee  shall furnish to Pretzel Time on said forms that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time:\n\n         (i) On Tuesday of each week,  a report on the Unit's net  revenues  and          sales and operations for the previous week;\n\n         (ii) Every six calendar month period,  a balance sheet and a profit and          loss statement for the Unit for the previous  semi-annual  period and a          year to-date  statement  of  financial  condition as of the end of such          previous period; and\n\n         (iii) Within  thirty (30) days after  Franchisee's  year end, an annual financial report.\n\nThe reports  required in Section 15.A. (ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.\n\n         15.B.   MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees, at all times, he shall keep and maintain  adequate, accurate,  true, and proper records, books, reports, data, and accounts relative to the  franchise  in the English  language  and in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and retain the records for a period of three (3) years  after  the date they  were  prepared,  from  which  there may be  readily determined the  information  required in the operating  reports to be filed with Pretzel Time.

AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.\n\n         16.A.    AUDITS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time or its  designee  shall have the right at any time during business  hours and without prior notice to  Franchisee,  to inspect,  audit and copy or the right to cause to be  inspected,  audited and copied,  the  business records,  bookkeeping and accounting  records,  sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchised Business,  including but not limited to,  daily  cash  reports,  cash  receipts  journal  and  general  ledger,  cash disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks; tax returns,  supplier invoices, dated cash register tapes, weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns and the books and records of any  corporation or  partnership  which holds the Franchise  including the personal financial records and tax returns of the Franchisee during and after the term of the Franchise Agreement.

Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.\n\n         In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n         16.B.

Inspect and copy any books,  records and  documents  relating to the          operation  of the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with          Pretzel Time in connection with any such inspections, observations,  photographing,  video  taping,  Product  removal and  interviews. Franchisee  shall present to his customers  such comment or evaluation  forms as Pretzel Time periodically  prescribes and shall  participate  and/or request his customers  to  participate  in any surveys  performed by or on behalf of Pretzel Time. At the conclusion of his inspection,  Pretzel Time's field  representative shall prepare a written report which shall contain all of his  observations  and conclusions.  If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.\n\n17.      TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT AND REPURCHASE.\n\n         17.A.  BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         This Agreement is fully transferable by Pretzel Time and shall inure to the benefit of any  assignee,  transferee  or other legal  successor  to Pretzel Time's interest  herein.  If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n         17.B.  BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Franchisee  understands  and  acknowledges  that the  rights and duties created by this Franchise Agreement are personal to Franchisee (or if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  to its  Owners) and that  Pretzel  Time has granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n         17.C.  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER.\n\n         If  Franchisee  is in full  compliance  with this  Agreement  (and,  if Franchisee is a corporation or  partnership,  its Owners are in full  compliance with this Agreement),  Pretzel Time shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of a Transfer that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n         (1) The  transferee  and its  Owners  must  meet  Pretzel  Time's  then          applicable  standards for Pretzel Time Unit  franchisees  and must have          had sufficient business experience,  aptitude,  and financial resources          to operate the Unit;\n\n\n\n\n\n         (2) Franchisee has paid such royalty,  advertising  fund fees,  amounts          owed for purchases by Franchisee  from Pretzel Time and its  Affiliates          and all other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates and third          party  creditors and shall have  submitted to Pretzel Time all required          reports and statements;\n\n         (3)  Franchisee or the  transferee has paid Pretzel Time's then current          transfer fee to defray expenses  Pretzel Time incurs in connection with          the  transfer,  except that if the  proposed  Transfer  is, to or among          Owners of Franchisee, this provision shall not apply;\n\n         (4) The  Transferee  and/or its Unit  Manager  have  agreed to complete          Pretzel  Time's  training  program to Pretzel Time's  satisfaction  and          prior to the date of transfer;\n\n         (5) The  Transferee  has  agreed  to be bound by all of the  terms  and          conditions of this Agreement and executes a current Franchise Agreement          and other franchise documents, a sublease agreement,  if any, and other          documents required by Pretzel Time;\n\n         (6) Franchisee  (and its  transferring  Owners) have executed a general          release,  in form  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time, of any and all claims          against Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their officers,  directors,          employees and agents;\n\n         (7) Pretzel Time has approved the material terms and conditions of such          Transfer,  including,  without limitation,  that the price and terms of          payment are not so burdensome as to affect  adversely the  transferee's          operation of the Unit; provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval          of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel          Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel          Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire          Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit; (8) If Franchisee  (and/or its Owners)          finances  any  part of the  sale  price  of the  transferred  interest,          Franchisee  and/or its Owners have agreed that all  obligations  of the          transferee  under or pursuant to any  promissory  notes,  agreements or          security  interests  reserved by Franchisee or its Owners in the assets          of the Unit or the Premises shall be  subordinate  to the  transferee's          obligations  to pay royalty and service  fees and other  amounts due to          Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  and  otherwise  to comply  with this          Agreement;\n\n         (9) Franchisee (and its Owners) have executed a noncompetition covenant          in favor of Pretzel Time and the transferee agreeing that, for a period          of twelve (12) months commencing on the effective date of the Transfer,          Franchisee,  its  Owners  and  members  of the  immediate  families  of          Franchisee  and each of its Owners will not hold any direct or indirect          interest  as  a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor,  partner,          director,  officer manager,  employee,  consultant,  representative  or          agent, or in any other capacity,  in a Competitive  Business located or          operating  within  three (3) miles of the Unit,  and  within  three (3)          miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit;\n\n         (10) If consent is required, the lessor of the Premises consents to the          assignment or sublease of the Premises to the transferee;\n\n         (11)  Franchisee  has complied with all of its  obligations  to Pretzel          Time, its Affiliates,  suppliers,  and distributors,  and Franchisee is          not in default under this Agreement or any other Agreement with Pretzel          Time or Pretzel Time's Affiliates;\n\n         (12)  All  improvements,  including  refurbishings,   remodelings,  new          equipment must be made prior to the Transfer; and\n\n         (13)  Franchisee  (and its Owners) has agreed that he will not directly          or  indirectly  at any time or in any manner  (except  with  respect to          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Franchisee)  identify  himself          or any  business  as a current or former  Pretzel  Time  Unit,  or as a          franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  use          any Mark, any colorable imitation thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel          Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize  for any purpose          any tradename,  trade or service mark or other  commercial  symbol that          suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or          its Affiliates.\n\n         17.D.    TRANSFER TO A WHOLLY-OWNED CORPORATION.\n\n         Notwithstanding Section 17.B., if Franchisee is in full compliance with this  Agreement,  Franchisee may transfer this Agreement to a corporation  which conducts no business  other than the Pretzel  Time Unit and in which  Franchisee maintains management control and owns and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the equity  and  voting  power of all  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock. Transfers of shares of such  corporation  will be subject to the  provisions  of Section 17.C.(2) and 17.C.(8).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Franchisee  shall  remain  personally  liable  under  this  Agreement  as if the Transfer to such  corporation had not occurred.  The articles of  incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents of such corporation shall recite that the issuance and  assignment of any interest  therein is restricted by the terms of Section 17 of this Franchise Agreement,  and all issued and outstanding stock certificates  of such  corporation  shall bear a legend reciting or referring to the restrictions hereof.\n\n         17.E.  FORMATION OF A CORPORATION.\n\n\n\n\n\n         In the event,  Franchisee  desires to form a  corporation  for the sole purpose of acting as a  Franchisee  under this  Agreement,  in  addition  to the conditions  imposed under Section 17, the following terms and conditions must be complied with, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Pretzel Time:\n\n                  (1) Franchisee  must be the owner of the majority  interest in                   the  voting  stock  of  the   corporation  and  the  principal                   executive officer thereof;\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee's  shareholders  shall enter into an agreement                   under seal with Pretzel Time, on Pretzel Time's standard form,                   guaranteeing  the  full  payment  of the  corporation's  money                   obligations to Pretzel Time as individual  surety and agreeing                   to be bound  individually  by the  non-competition  obligation                   stated herein; and\n\n                  (3) Franchisee and all shareholders  must continue to meet its                   obligations  under  the  noncompetition   provisions  of  this                   Agreement.\n\n         In  the  event   Franchisee  or  its  successor  is  a  corporation  or partnership or similar entity, it is agreed as follows:\n\n                  (1) That the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-Laws or the                   Partnership  Agreement,  shall  reflect  that the issuance and                   transfer of voting stock or other ownership  interest therein,                   is restricted by the terms of this Agreement. Franchisee shall                   furnish  Pretzel  Time at the  time of the  execution  of this                   Agreement or of assignment to the  corporation  or partners of                   Franchisee, a written agreement stating that no stockholder or                   partner  will  sell,  assign  or  transfer  voluntarily  or by                   operation  of law  any  securities  of  Franchisee,  or  other                   ownership  interest  in  Franchisee,  to any  person or entity                   other than existing shareholders or partnership, to the extent                   permitted  hereunder,  without  the prior  written  consent of                   Pretzel Time.  All securities  issued by Franchisee  will bear                   the  following  legend  which  shall be  printed  legibly  and                   conspicuously  on each stock  certificate or other evidence of                   Ownership Interest:\n\n                    \"The  transfer of these  securities  is subject to the terms                     and  conditions of a Franchise  Agreement with Pretzel Time,                     Inc.  dated , 199____.  Reference is made to said  Agreement                     and to  the  restrictive  provisions  of  the  Articles  and                     By-laws or Shareholders or Partnership Agreement.\"\n\n                  (2) That if Franchisee or a successor,  is a corporation,  the                   majority of the capital stock thereof shall not at any time or                   in the  aggregate  be sold,  assigned,  pledged,  mortgaged or                   transferred without the prior written consent of Pretzel Time.\n\n                  (3) Franchisee  represents and warrants that its Owners are as                   set  forth  on  Exhibit  B  attached  to  this  Agreement  and                   covenants that it will not vary from that ownership  structure                   without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.F.  DEATH OR DISABILITY OF FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Upon the death or Permanent  Disability of Franchisee or, if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  the  Owner  of a  Controlling  Interest  in Franchisee, the executor, administrator, conservator, guardian or other personal representative  of such  person  shall  transfer  Franchisee's  interest in this Agreement or such interest in  Franchisee  to a third party  approved by Pretzel Time.  Such  disposition  of this  Agreement  or  such  interest  in  Franchisee (including,  without  limitation,  transfer by bequest or inheritance)  shall be completed  within a reasonable  time, not to exceed six (6) months from the date of death or  Permanent  Disability,  and shall be  subject  to all the terms and conditions  applicable to Transfers contained in Section 17.B. and 17.C. Failure to transfer the interest in this Agreement or such interest in Franchisee within said period of time shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n         17.G.    PRETZEL TIME'S FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.\n\n          If  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall at any time  determine to sell, assign or transfer for consideration  this Agreement or an Ownership Interest in Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide, executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership, copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit and may not  include  an offer to  purchase  any  other  property  or  rights of Franchisee (or its Owners).  However,  if the offeror  proposes to buy any other property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate, contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value for any other property or rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer, provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation, representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock, and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets, validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit. The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).\n\n          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.H.    PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS.\n\n         In the event  Franchisee (or any of its Owners)  shall,  subject to the restrictions  and  conditions  of Transfer  contained in Section 17,  attempt to raise or secure funds by the sale of securities (including,  without limitation, common or preferred stock,  bonds,  debentures or general or limited partnership interests) in Franchisee or any affiliate of Franchisee, Franchisee, recognizing that the written information may reflect upon Pretzel Time, agrees to submit any such written information used with respect thereto prior to its inclusion in any registration  statement,  prospectus or similar offering  circular or memorandum and to obtain Pretzel Time's written consent to the method of financing prior to any offering or sale of such securities. Pretzel Time's written consent pursuant to this Section  shall not imply or  constitute  Pretzel  Time's  approval  with respect to the sale of the  securities,  the  offering  literature  submitted to Pretzel  Time or any other aspect of the  offering.  No  information  respecting Pretzel  Time  shall  be  included  in  any  disclosure   document  unless  such information  has  been  furnished  by  Pretzel  Time  in  writing   pursuant  to Franchisee's  written request,  in which Franchisee states the specific purposes for  which the  information  is to be used.  Should  Pretzel  Time,  in its sole discretion, object to any reference to it or its business or to the relationship of  Franchisee  or  a  controlled  affiliate  in  such  offering  literature  or prospectus,  such  literature or  prospectus  shall not be used unless and until Pretzel Time's objections are withdrawn.  Pretzel Time assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any offering.  Franchisee  shall pay Pretzel  Time's  expenses in connection with the offering or proposed offering.\n\n         The prospectus or other literature  utilized in any such offering shall contain the  following  language in  bold-face  type on the first  textual  page thereof:\n\n         PRETZEL  TIME,  INC. IS NOT  DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  THE ISSUER OF THE          SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO          THIS OFFERING AND/OR THE SUFFICIENCY OR ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION SET          FORTH HEREIN,  INCLUDING ANY  STATEMENTS  WITH RESPECT TO PRETZEL TIME,          INC.  PRETZEL TIME,  INC.  DOES NOT ENDORSE OR MAKE ANY  RECOMMENDATION          WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS OFFERING.\n\n         Franchisee  (and each of its Owners)  agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Pretzel Time, its parent company, subsidiaries, and Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims, demands and  liabilities,  and all costs and expenses  (including,  without  limitation, reasonable  attorneys' fees) incurred in defending against such claims,  demands or  liabilities,  arising  from the  offer or sale of such  securities,  whether asserted  by a  purchaser  of any such  security  or by a  governmental  agency. Pretzel  Time shall have the right (but not the  obligation)  to defend any such claims,  demands or  liabilities  and/or to  participate  in the  defense of any action to which it is named as a party.\n\n18.      TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         18.A.  FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.\n\n         If  Franchisee is in  substantial  compliance  with this  Agreement and Pretzel Time  substantially  breaches a material provision of this Agreement and (1) fails to cure such  breach  within  thirty  (30) days after  written  notice thereof is delivered to Pretzel Time or (2) if such breach cannot  reasonably be cured  within  thirty (30) days after  Pretzel  Time's  receipt of such  notice, undertake  (within  thirty (30) days after Pretzel Time's receipt of such notice and  continue  until  completion),  reasonable  efforts  to  cure  such  breach, Franchisee may terminate this Agreement. Such termination shall be effective ten (10) days after delivery to Pretzel Time of notice that such breach has not been cured and Franchisee  elects to terminate this Agreement.  A termination of this Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by Pretzel Time, and Pretzel Time's failure to cure  such  breach  as  provided  above  shall  be  deemed a  termination  by Franchisee without cause.\n\n19.      DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.\n\n         19.A.  EXACT AND COMPLETE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges that complete  performance of all the terms of this  Agreement  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of  Pretzel  Time  and its franchisees.  It is therefore agreed that complete and exact  performance by the Franchisee  of each of his  promises  contained  herein  is a  condition  to the continuance of this Franchise.\n\n         19.B.    DEFAULT AND RIGHT TO CURE.\n\n         If Franchisee  defaults in the  performance of any of the terms of this Agreement  or the  Operations  Manual,  Pretzel  Time,  in addition to all other remedies  available to it at law or in equity and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies,  may  immediately  terminate  this Agreement by delivering a written notice to Franchisee of any breach of this Agreement and a notice period of  forty-five  (45) days shall be given to  Franchisee,  unless such default is cured by the  Franchisee  within thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Pretzel Time to Franchisee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.\n\n         19.C.  EXTENSION OF NOTICE.\n\n         If any  applicable  law or rule  requires  a  greater  prior  notice of termination,  the prior notice required by such law or rule shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.\n\n         19.D.  REPEATED BREACHES.\n\n         Further,   notwithstanding  anything  herein  elsewhere  contained,  if Franchisee shall repeatedly fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,  or any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which right shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Pretzel Time may be entitled  under this  Agreement or otherwise  under applicable law. As used in this Agreement the term \"repeatedly  fail\" shall mean three (3) defaults within any twelve (12) month period, even if the defaults are later cured.          19.E.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT - 30 DAYS NOTICE - CURABLE DEFAULTS.\n\n         The  occurrence of any one of the following  events shall  constitute a default under this Agreement  requiring a 30 day notice period of termination by Pretzel Time to Franchisee:\n\n                  (i) Franchisee  fails to pay money when due to Pretzel Time as                   required  under the Franchise  Agreement,  including,  without                   limitation,  the franchise  fee, the renewal fee, the transfer                   fee, royalties, and the advertising fund fee;

or\n\n                  (iii) If Franchisee  fails to submit to Pretzel Time financial                   or other  information  when required  under this  Agreement or                   submits a financial statement which materially understates net                   revenues;

or\n\n                  (x)  Franchisee  denies  Pretzel Time the right to inspect the                   Unit or to examine or audit his books; or\n\n                  (xi)  Franchisee  misuses  Pretzel Time's Marks or asserts any                   interest  in  Pretzel   Time's  Marks;

TELEPHONE COMPANY.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.\n\n         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.

LEASING.\n\n         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.\n\n         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.\n\n         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.

Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.\n\nThe Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.\n\nNeither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.\n\n         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.\n\n         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:\n\n                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including                   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)                   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period                   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market                   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and                   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete                   or discontinued), or\n\n                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)                   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).                   \"Cash  flow\"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all                   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,                   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual                   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and                   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and                   depreciation.\n\n         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.\n\n         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or\n\n\n\n\n\nits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.\n\n21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.\n\n         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation\n\nany Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:\n\n         (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,          partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent          or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or          operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time          Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of          termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit          operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or\n\n         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding          six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time          Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or          licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written          permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.\n\n         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.\n\n         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\n\n         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n         21.C.    TAXES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.\n\n         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not\n\n\n\n\n\nbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.\n\n         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.\n\n         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.\n\n         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.\n\n22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.\n\n         22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees (\"Confidential Information\"):\n\n         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,          policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and          knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and          franchising of Pretzel Time Units:\n\n         (2) site selection criteria;\n\n         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;\n\n         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,          recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of          the Products;\n\n         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and          knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,          materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;\n\n         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for          Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge          of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;\n\n         (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and\n\n         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial          performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,\n\n\n\n\n\nofficers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:\n\n         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time          System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,          without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee          may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to          disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such          information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement          and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto          as Exhibit H);\n\n         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;\n\n         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential          Information during and after the term of this Agreement;\n\n         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential          Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and\n\n         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or          disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,          restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.\n\n         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.\n\n         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.\n\n23.      ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         23.A.    UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS.\n\n         Delays in the  performance  of any duties  hereunder  which are not the fault of, and not within the reasonable  preventive control of, the party due to perform,  including but not limited to, fire,  flood,  labor  disputes,  natural disasters, acts of God, civil disorders, riots,  insurrections,  work stoppages, slowdowns or disputes,  or other  similar  events,  shall not cause a default in said  performance,  but the parties shall extend the time of  performance  for a period of time equivalent to the length of delay,  or for such other  reasonable period of time as agreed by the parties.\n\n         23.B.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.\n\n         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.\n\n         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's\n\n\n\n\n\nprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject\n\nto continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.\n\n          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.\n\n         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.\n\n         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.\n\n         23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n         Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.\n\n         23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n         Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  \"1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.\n\n         23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.\n\n         Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.\n\n         23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement  executed by both parties hereto.

HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.\n\n         Subject to the provisions  hereof  relating to transfer and assignment, this Agreement is intended to and does bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of any or all of the parties hereto.\n\n         23.K.    CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.\n\n         The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.\n\n         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.\n\n         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.\n\n         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.          23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE\n\n         THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.\n\n         23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\n\n     BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND THE  FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY.  THE PARTIES  FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SHALL DEMAND A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION.\n\n         23.P.  WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n         EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATION  TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME, THE PARTIES WAIVE TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER AND AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE  BETWEEN THEM,  THE PARTY MAKING A CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUSTAINS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         23.Q.  EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.\n\n         BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND  FRANCHISEE  AGREE THAT ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING  TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  THE OFFER AND GRANTING OF THE FRANCHISE  RIGHTS  HEREUNDER  SHALL BE INSTITUTED AND MAINTAINED ONLY IN A STATE OR FEDERAL  COURT OF  GENERAL  JURISDICTION  IN DAUPHIN  COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA  OR THE COUNTY IN WHICH PRETZEL TIME MAINTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL  PLACE OF BUSINESS.\n\n         FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE  JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION  FRANCHISEE MAY HAVE TO EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF SUCH COURT.\n\n         23.R.    LIMITATIONS OF CLAIMS\n\n         EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS  BROUGHT BY PRETZEL TIME WITH REGARD TO  FRANCHISEE'S OBLIGATIONS  TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO PRETZEL TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND PRETZEL  TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE BARRED  UNLESS AN ACTION IS COMMENCED  WITHIN:  (1) TWO (2)  YEARS  FROM THE DATE ON WHICH  THE ACT OR EVENT GIVING  RISE TO THE  CLAIM  OCCURRED  OR (2) ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH FRANCHISEE  OR  PRETZEL  TIME KNEW OR SHOULD  HAVE  KNOWN,  IN THE  EXERCISE  OF REASONABLE  DILIGENCE OF THE FACTS GIVEN RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS,  WHICHEVER  OCCURS FIRST.\n\n24.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has read this  Agreement  and that he understands  and accepts the terms,  conditions and covenants  contained in this Agreement as being reasonably  necessary to maintain Pretzel Time's high quality and service and the uniformity of those  standards at all Pretzel Time Units and thereby to protect and preserve the goodwill of the Marks.\n\n         Pretzel Time  disclaims  and  Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has not received or relied upon any representations, promises, guarantees or warranties, expressed  or  implied,  made to induce the  execution  hereof or in  connection herewith which is not expressly contained herein or in the disclosure statement.

Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time's officers, directors, employees and agents act only in a representative  and not in a personal capacity in connection with any of their dealings with  Franchisee.  Franchisee  recognizes that neither Pretzel Time nor any other person can guarantee  Franchisee's success in the franchised business.

SECURITY INTEREST.\n\n         In order  to  secure  full and  prompt  payment  of the fees and  other charges to be paid by Franchisee to Pretzel Time,  and to secure  performance of the other  obligations  and covenants to be performed by Franchisee,  under this Agreement,  Franchisee hereby grants Pretzel Time a valid and effectual security interest  in,  lien  upon,  and  right of set off  against  all of  Franchisee's interest  in  the  improvements,  fixtures,  inventory,  goods,  appliances  and equipment now or hereafter owned and located at the Unit (whether annexed to the Premises or not) or used in connection with the business  conducted at the Unit, including,  without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing,  all machinery,  materials,  appliances and fixtures for  generating or  distributing air, water, heat,  electricity,  light, fuel or refrigeration,  for ventilating, cooling or sanitary purposes, for the exclusion of vermin or insects and for the removal  of  dust,   refuse  or  garbage;   all   engines,   machinery,   ovens, refrigerators,   freezers,  furnaces,   partitions,  doors,  vaults,  sprinkling systems, light fixtures,  fire hoses, fire brackets,  fire boxes, alarm systems, brackets,  screens,  floor tile,  linoleum,  carpets,  plumbing,  water systems, appliances,  walk-in refrigerator boxes, cabinets,  dishwashers,  stoves, set-up tables,  rolling  counters,   kitchen  ranges,  display  counters  and  shelves, humidified  cabinets,  computers and computer software,  and other equipment and installations;  all other and  further  installations  and  appliances;  all raw materials,   work  in  process,  finished  goods  and  all  inventory;  and  all replacements  thereof,  attachments,   additions  and  accessions  thereto,  and products  and  proceeds  thereof  in any  form,  including  but not  limited  to insurance proceeds and any claims against third parties for loss or damage to or destruction  of any or all of the foregoing  (collectively,  the  \"Collateral\").

The foregoing right of first refusal shall cease in the event of a Change of Control of either RemainCo or SpinCo, provided, however, that the Parties will discuss the feasibility of future collaboration, specifically related to the contribution of nuclear related subject matter by RemainCo, in good faith in the event of a Change of Control.\n\n(d) RemainCo shall have, and SpinCo hereby grants to RemainCo, an unlimited, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide right and license to use the content contained in the Steam Book, including the current edition and any past edition and any future edition to which RemainCo makes a contribution, for any purpose, including, without limitation, to reproduce, publicly display, modify, make derivative works, distribute, publicly perform and distribute for RemainCo's internal business purposes, including in connection with customer related activities, provided, however, that RemainCo shall (i) not use any non-nuclear content contained in the Steam Book in connection with publishing or distributing a publication which competes with the Steam Book and (ii) provide attribution and accreditation using a copyright notice having the format required by law in connection with the use of any protectable expression of the non-nuclear content contained in the Steam Book. SpinCo shall provide RemainCo with five hundred (500) copies of the current edition of the Steam Book at no cost to RemainCo, which copies RemainCo may distribute without limitation, including to RemainCo customers at no charge. In the event that RemainCo wishes to order additional copies of the current edition of the Steam Book or has a desire to purchase existing stock of earlier editions of the Steam Book, SpinCo will sell such copies to RemainCo at cost, which copies RemainCo may distribute without limitation, including to RemainCo customers at no charge.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nTRADEMARKS\n\nSection 3.1 House Marks.\n\n(a) RemainCo agrees and acknowledges that (i) as of Distribution Date, as between the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group, all right, title and interest in and to the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the \"SpinCo Trademarks\"), including the SpinCo House Marks, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the SpinCo Group and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2, the RemainCo Group shall cease and discontinue all use of the SpinCo Marks, including the SpinCo House Marks, as of the Distribution Date. In addition, RemainCo agrees to use its best efforts to change its name to eliminate Babcock & Wilcox therefrom, and, if applicable, to cause the members of the RemainCo Group to change their names to eliminate \"Babcock,\" \"Wilcox,\" \"Babcock and Wilcox,\" \"Babcock & Wilcox\" or \"B&W\" therefrom and to cease and discontinue the use of the term \"Babcock & Wilcox\" or \"B&W\" and any of the   8\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinCo Marks in its business or operations as promptly as practicable following the Distribution Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpinCo agrees and acknowledges that RemainCo will change its name to BWX Technologies and that RemainCo and the RemainCo Group may continue to use \"BW\" and derivations thereof and therefrom (but not \"B&W\") in its business or operations after the Distribution Date. SpinCo agrees not to, and shall not permit any member of the SpinCo Group to, oppose, petition to cancel, or otherwise challenge or object to the use of or any current application and/or subsequent application for registration by RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group of any RemainCo House Marks as long as such use and/or registration does not make use of the SpinCo House Marks and further agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by RemainCo and execute or cause to be executed by the appropriate members of the SpinCo Group such other agreements, instruments and other documents, including coexistence agreements and letters of consent, as may be reasonably requested by RemainCo to facilitate the registration and continued prosecution of RemainCo House Marks (e.g., in the event that any SpinCo House Mark is cited against an application for a RemainCo House Mark).\n\n(b) RemainCo agrees not to, and shall not permit any member of the RemainCo Group to, oppose, petition to cancel, or otherwise challenge or object to the use of or any current application and/or subsequent application for registration by SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo House Marks, as long as such use and/or registration does not make use of the RemainCo House Marks and further agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by SpinCo and execute or cause to be executed by the appropriate members of the RemainCo Group such other agreements, instruments and other documents, including coexistence agreements and letters of consent, as may be reasonably requested by SpinCo to facilitate the registration and continued prosecution of SpinCo House Marks (e.g., in the event that any RemainCo House Mark is cited against an application for a SpinCo House Mark).\n\nSection 3.2 Limited License to Use SpinCo House Marks. RemainCo shall have the right to use the SpinCo House Marks in connection with the operation of the RemainCo Business for a limited period of 270 days following the Distribution Date. After such 270-day period, RemainCo shall discontinue all use of the SpinCo House Marks, including any use on stationery or letterhead and any use on or in connection with other RemainCo Assets. However, the Parties agree that the RemainCo Group may continue, beyond such 270-day period, to distribute copies of any existing inventory of its marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, in existence on the Distribution Date, provided, however, that reasonable efforts are made to remove or cover up any SpinCo House Marks appearing thereon prior to distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2, in no event shall any of the members of the RemainCo Group continue to use the SpinCo House Marks (whether in any of the materials referenced in the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise) following a Change of Control of RemainCo. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the foregoing shall apply to any stationery, letterhead or marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, distributed by any member of the RemainCo Group to its customers prior to the Distribution Date or to any SpinCo House Marks included on or in any copies of the Steam Book distributed by RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group prior to or after the Distribution Date. All of RemainCo's use of the SpinCo House Marks shall inure to the benefit of SpinCo. RemainCo agrees to use the SpinCo House Marks in accordance with such quality standards as are used by the SpinCo Group as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Section 3.2, it is expressly agreed that RemainCo is not obtaining any right, title or interest in the SpinCo House Marks.   9\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.3 Removal of Classes from SpinCo Marks.\n\n(a) Within sixty (60) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to (i) as applicable, amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter included in any existing registration for any SpinCo House Mark registered in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, Romania, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Ukraine, the European Union and Argentina and (ii) as applicable, to amend or modify the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter contained in any application pending for any SpinCo House Mark in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, Romania, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Ukraine, the European Union and Argentina. Without limiting the foregoing, within sixty (60) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to amend the description of goods and services to remove referenced to nuclear subject matter from the registrations and applications for SpinCo House Marks listed on Schedule 3.3.\n\n(b) Within ninety (90) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to (i) as applicable, amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter included in any existing registration for any SpinCo Trademarks (other than SpinCo House Marks otherwise covered by Section 3.3(a)) and (ii) as applicable, amend or modify any application pending for any SpinCo Mark (other than SpinCo House Marks otherwise covered by Section 3.3(a)) to amend the description of goods and services to remove references to nuclear subject matter contained in such application.\n\nSection 3.4 RemainCo Marks. SpinCo agrees and acknowledges that (i) as of the Date of this Agreement, as between the SpinCo Group and the RemainCo Group, all right, title and interest in and to the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 3.4 (the \"RemainCo Trademarks\") shall be the sole and exclusive property of the RemainCo Group and the SpinCo Group shall cease and discontinue all use of the RemainCo Marks as of the Distribution Date.\n\nSection 3.5 Duty to Avoid Confusion. The Parties confirm their belief that the likelihood of confusion will not result from their respective use of the SpinCo Marks and RemainCo Marks, including RemainCo's continuing use of the name BWX Technologies and continued use of the terms \"BWX\", \"BWX Technologies\" or \"BWXT\" and derivations thereof and therefrom, due to the differences in the goods and services primarily associated therewith (e.g., nuclear versus fossil fuel). In the event that either Party becomes aware of any actual confusion or mistake occurring as a result of their uses of their respective marks, the Parties agree to communicate all details of each such instance to each other, and to cooperate reasonably to take steps to abate the cause of confusion or mistake, and to prevent any such confusion or mistake from arising again.   10\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nSHARED LIBRARY MATERIALS\n\nSection 4.1 Shared Library Materials. RemainCo and SpinCo acknowledge and agree that the Shared Library Materials represent a collection of shared historical and foundational information related to and derived from more than fifty (50) years of research and development focused on technology and design criteria applicable to the businesses of RemainCo and SpinCo, which information, including all Know-How and Copyrights contained therein, has application to the businesses of RemainCo and SpinCo. The Shared Library Materials identified as of the Distribution Date are set forth on Schedule 4.1, which may be amended or modified upon mutual agreement of the Parties from time to time to (i) include additional Shared Library Materials discovered after the Distribution Date or (ii) to reflect the results of the allocation process contemplated in Section 4.4 below.\n\nSection 4.2 Cross-License of Shared Library Materials.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Shared Library Materials may contain limited material that could be allocated solely to one Party with respect to ownership and use.

The Reviewing Party will designate at least one representative from the relevant operating division to review and negotiate the proposed allocation. The Parties, including the designated representatives, shall negotiate regarding the Notifying Party's proposal in good faith.

The Parties acknowledge that the Shared Library Materials contain Third Party-owned material, including, without limitation, the Reference Materials, and this Agreement does not include any license to utilize such Third Party-owned material or any representation, warranty or indemnity from or to SpinCo or RemainCo or any member of the SpinCo Group or RemainCo Group related to the use of such Third Party-owned material in connection with the Shared Library Materials.\n\nARTICLE V\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSES AND COVENANTS\n\nSection 5.1 Cross-License of Shared Know-How.\n\n(a) SpinCo, for itself and as representative of all other members of the SpinCo Group, hereby grants to RemainCo (x) a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the SpinCo Know- How currently or previously used in connection with the RemainCo Business or otherwise in the possession of RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group as of Distribution Date (the \"Licensed SpinCo Know-How\"), for the continued operation of the RemainCo Business and any future extensions of the RemainCo Business in the RemainCo Core Field and (y) a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Licensed SpinCo Know-How for the continued operation of the RemainCo Business and any future extensions of the RemainCo Business in any field other than the RemainCo Core Field or the SpinCo Core Field; provided, however, the foregoing licenses shall not extend to (i) SpinCo Know-How   13\n\n\n\n\n\nlicensed by SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group if and to the extent the licensing of same to RemainCo would constitute a breach of an agreement with any Third Party executed prior to the Effective Date or result in any expense to SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group for payments to such Third Party or (ii) any intellectual property not owned by one or more members of the SpinCo Group, or as to which no member of the SpinCo Group has the right to grant sublicenses, as of the Effective Date.\n\n(b) RemainCo, for itself and as representative of all other members of the RemainCo Group, hereby grants to SpinCo (x) a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the RemainCo Know-How currently or previously used in connection with the SpinCo Business or otherwise in the possession of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group as of the Distribution Date (the \"Licensed RemainCo Know-How\"), for the continued operation of the SpinCo Business and any future extensions of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Core Field and (y) a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license with the right to grant sublicenses (solely as set forth in Section 5.6) to use the Licensed RemainCo Know-How for the continued operation of the SpinCo Business and any future extensions of the SpinCo Business in any field other than the RemainCo Core Field or the SpinCo Core Field; provided, however, the foregoing licenses shall not extend to (i) RemainCo Know-How licensed by RemainCo or any other member of the RemainCo Group if and to the extent the licensing of same to SpinCo would constitute a breach of an agreement with any Third Party executed prior to the Effective Date or result in any expense to RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group for payments to such Third Party or (ii) any intellectual property not owned by one or more members of the RemainCo Group, or as to which no member of the RemainCo Group has the right to grant sublicenses, as of the Effective Date.\n\nSection 5.2 Reserved.\n\nSection 5.3 Reserved.\n\nSection 5.4 Cross-Licenses of Software.\n\n(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that each of RemainCo and SpinCo and additional members of the RemainCo Group and SpinCo Group presently have shared access to and rights to exploit the Software set forth on Schedule 5.4(a) (the \"Foundational Software\") and may have a right and interest in and to the Foundational Software, including in and to Intellectual Property embodied therein.

Notwithstanding                   the foregoing, the parties agree to issue an initial press                   release regarding the relationship between Excite and                   NetGrocer, the timing and wording of which will be mutually                   agreed upon,.\n\n7.

Under this program, Excite and                   each CPG merchant would develop co-branded Web pages on the                   Excite Network that would promote the merchant's goods cr                   provide content of interest to Excite's users. Excite would                   run dual promotional efforts, one that sends consumers to                   each CPG merchant's co-branded area and a second that sends                   consumers to the portion of the Excite Network that promotes                   the entire CPG program. Excite and NetGrocer agree to                   negotiate in good faith to establish the terms and conditions                   for NetGrocer's participation in Excite's CPG program when                   and if launched.\n\n         b)       Excite currently plans to make available sponsorship                   opportunities on its WebCrawler Site (located at                   http://www.webcrawler.com) generally similar to the                   opportunity described by this Agreement, with the significant                   exception that merchants will not be granted category                   exclusivity or rights to exclude competitors on the                   WebCrawler Site. Excite and NetGrocer agree to negotiate in                   good faith to establish the terms and conditions for                   NetGrocer's participation in available sponsorship                   opportunities on the WebCrawler Site when and if launched.\n\n                                      -9-\n\n8.

Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of                   a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or                   trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be                   entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other                   available legal remedies in a court of competent                   jurisdiction.\n\n                                      -12-\n\n         b)       In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or                   concerning in any manner the subject matter of this\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, the parties will first attempt to resolve                   the dispute(s) through good faith negotiation. In the event                   that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to a                   mutually acceptable mediator for hearing.\n\n         c)       In the event that disputes between the parties arising from                   or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this                   Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the                   dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for                   resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator                   pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules                   applicable to commercial disputes.\n\n14.

Any attempt to assign this Agreement other                   than as permitted above will be null and void.\n\n         b)       Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and                   construed in accordance with the laws of the State of                   California, notwithstanding the actual state or country of                   residence or incorporation of NetGrocer.\n\n         c)       Notice.

The parties are independent contractors and will                   have no power or authority to assume or create any obligation                   or responsibility on behalf of each other. This Agreement                   will not be construed to create or imply any partnership,                   agency or joint venture.\n\n                                      -13-\n\n         e)       Force Majeure. Any delay in or failure of performance by                   either party under this Agreement will not be considered a                   breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent                   caused by any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of                   such party including, but not limited to, acts of God, power                   outages and governmental restrictions. Notwithstanding the                   foregoing, either party may terminate the Agreement in the                   event that a delay due to force majeure continues for a                   period of sixty (60) uninterrupted days.\n\n         f)       Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this                   Agreement are held by to be unenforceable by a court or                   arbitrator, the remaining portions of the Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n         g)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and                   exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the                   subject matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements and                   communications (both written and oral) regarding such subject                   matter.

SPECIAL RIGHT OF TERMINATION. Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensor if the commercial value of the Duval Identification is substantially reduced because Duval (i) has engaged in illegal or immoral conduct resulting in a felony conviction; or (ii) fails an officially sanctioned drug test or is criminally convicted of any drug related offense. Any termination pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the 30th day next following the date of receipt by Licensor of Company's written notice to so terminate.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n         17.

For purposes of this Agreement, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act.\n\n3.2 Private Purchase.In addition to Market Purchases, as described in Section 3.1 above, HOC shall be entitled to make Private Agreement Purchases, provided that such purchases are made in accordance with all applicable laws; and provided further, that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, unless the Parties otherwise agree, the HOC Entities will not beneficially own more than forty percent (40%) of the Company's outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis following any Market Purchase and/or Private Agreement Purchase.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Rights Notice shall be deemed to include sufficient information to make such investment decision if it includes the information specified in items (i) to (iv) of Section 4.1(d). If no Acceptance Notice has been provided to the Company within the required time, HOC will be deemed to have elected not to subscribe for or purchase any such Additional Securities.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Following delivery of the Acceptance Notice, if any, the HOC Entities shall pay for, and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens, the number of Additional Securities specified in the Acceptance Notice and, except as otherwise agreed, the Company shall provide HOC with substantially the same closing documents, including opinions, if applicable, as are delivered to the other persons subscribing for Additional Securities on the closing date for such issuance.\n\n(g) The rights granted to HOC under this Article 4 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if HOC does not exercise Option and complete the purchase of the Additional Shares.\n\nARTICLE 5 BOARD REPRESENTATION\n\n5.1 Appointment of HOC Nominee. If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the \"HOC Director\"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.\n\n5.2 Increase in Membership of the Board of Directors. If HOC acquires the Additional Shares and subsequently acquires additional Shares such that it holds a Pro Rata Interest of 40% or more, HOC shall be entitled to appoint one (1) additional individual to the Board of Directors. For greater clarity, if HOC exercises the Option and holds a Pro Rata Interest of at least 40%, HOC shall be entitled to appoint a total of two (2) individuals to the Board of Directors. Upon receipt of a nomination from HOC for the second director and its satisfaction that the individual meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable law, the Board of Directors agrees to expand its membership to five positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that so long as HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 35%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.

If (x) one or both HOC Directors do not meet the individual qualifications for a director prescribed by applicable laws, (y) the Pro Rata Interest of HOC falls below 14.5%, or (z) the provisions of Section 8.2 hereof become applicable and the Company delivers notice to HOC to that effect, all of the HOC Directors shall forthwith resign; provided, however, that in the event of (x), HOC shall then be entitled to appoint an individual to replace the resigning director(s) and such resigning director(s) shall be afforded the benefits of any indemnity and insurance as may exist for all matters occurring prior to such resignation.\n\n5.5 Indemnification and Director's and Officer's Insurance. So long as HOC is entitled to nominate and maintain a director pursuant to this Article 5, the Company shall indemnify each current and former HOC Director and shall maintain director's and officer's liability insurance for the benefit of each such director, with the same rights and benefits as are accorded the directors of the Company generally.\n\nARTICLE 6  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER\n\nThe provisions of this Article 6 shall apply if, but only if, HOC exercises the Option and acquires the Additional Shares and so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 do not apply:\n\n6.1 Joint Venture\n\n  (a) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries decides to seek a joint venture partner to develop, acquire or otherwise earn an interest in any Properties including the Existing Properties, in circumstances where the Company's participation in such joint venture is not dependent on the participation of a particular third party as joint venture partner (such as in the case of an earn-in) (each a \"Proposed Joint Venture\"), the Company shall immediately provide notice to HOC (the \"Joint Venture Proposal Notice\") specifying sufficient information regarding the particulars of the Proposed Joint Venture to allow HOC to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, including to the extent any such terms are determinable at such time: (A) a description of the Property in respect of which the Proposed Joint Venture relates, and (B) the terms, including the purchase price, for the Proposed Joint Venture, and if applicable, a true copy of any related term sheet setting forth such terms.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1 shall prevent the Company from concurrently negotiating with third parties with respect to those matters set out in this Section 6.1.\n\n  (b) If HOC, acting reasonably, determines that the Joint Venture Proposal Notice contains insufficient information to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, it shall notify the Company of the information required to make such decision and thereafter shall have the greater of (i) five (5) Business Days from the receipt of such information from the Company, and (ii) the days remaining in the period specified in Section 6.2 to make such decision and deliver or refrain from delivering the HOC JV Acceptance Notice in accordance with such Section 6.2.

or\n\n11\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination\n\n\n\n\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination transaction or other extraordinary transaction involving or relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or an intention to make an offer to the Company and/or its subsidiaries to undertake such a transaction, by any person or group of persons (other than any HOC Entities) which would, if completed, result in (I) any class of outstanding equity securities being converted into cash or securities of another person resulting in shareholders holding less than 50% of the equity and/or voting securities of the resulting entity; or (II) all or substantially all of the Company's assets being sold to any person or group of persons (other than any HOC Entities) (a \"Business Combination Transaction\"), provided that in the case of this Section 6.1(b)(ii)(B) HOC must make such Acquisition Proposal confidentially to the Board of Directors and not by way of public offer to the shareholders.\n\n  For greater certainty, if HOC has commenced an Acquisition Proposal in reliance on this Section 6.1(b)(ii) or in respect of Section 6.1(b)(ii)(B), has agreed with the Company to an Acquisition Proposal, prior to the withdrawal or cancellation of such Tender Offer Transaction or Business Combination Transaction, HOC shall not be precluded from continuing with such Acquisition Proposal by reason only of the withdrawal or cancellation of any relevant Tender Offer Transaction or Business Combination Transaction; or\n\n  (iii) if a person or group of persons other than any of the HOC Entities, the Company or its subsidiaries obtains proxies carrying a majority of the votes attached to all outstanding voting securities of the Company and exercises such votes to replace the Board of Directors.\n\n7.2 Most Favored Nation.

Each purchase order shall specify the bill-to address, ship-to address, quantity and description of each Xplore Product ordered, the unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications, if any. Orders received without this information or which contain any discrepancy may be returned to Distributor for completion or revision as applicable. Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes.

Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.

Should such purchase orders be subject to alternative rights, Xplore shall inform Distributor of alternative rights prior to order acceptance.

The Parties intend, following the Effective Date, to organize meetings of internal staff to communicate and explain the provisions of this Agreement to ensure the efficient and timely Development and Commercialization of the Collaboration Products.   ARTICLE 4 DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS   4.1. Pooling of Compounds. Subject to and consistent with the further Development principles outlined herein, each Party will offer a minimum of four (4) identified LABA compounds to this collaboration, with the intention of commercializing at least one Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist as a single agent and/or as a LABA/ICS Combination Product. Upon commencement of the collaboration pursuant to this Agreement, GSK and Theravance will contribute the following LABA compounds as Pooled Compounds to the collaboration:   GSK Compounds GW 597901, GW 678007, GW 642444 and GW 774419 and Theravance Compounds TD-3327 and AMI-15471.   For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed and hereby acknowledged by both Parties that the compounds GW 597901, GW 678007, GW 642444 and GW 774419, TD-3327 and AMI-15471 are hereby accepted as Pooled Compounds.   Theravance will provide two (2) Theravance New Compounds to the collaboration within eighteen (18) months of the Effective Date in order to meet the requirement that Theravance contribute a total of four (4) LABA compounds to the Pooled Compounds. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GSK will endeavor to provide Theravance, upon Theravance's request and at GSK's expense and discretion, such assistance as may be reasonably required by Theravance to achieve this objective, including providing directly or through GSK's vendors, assistance in (i) chemical process development, (ii) salt selection, (iii) pharmaceutical formulation, (iv) toxicological evaluation, and (v) API preparation.   4.2 Obligations for Development.   4.2.1 General; GSK. Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will determine the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will endeavor to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In   17\n\n\n\n\n\n  relation to the foregoing, GSK shall have the overall responsibility for, and use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of all such Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK shall also use Diligent Efforts to contribute at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and Diligent Efforts to develop an optimal inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel.   4.2.2 GSK Funding Responsibility. GSK shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the Development of Collaboration Products for Commercialization including those incurred by Theravance (or to which it has become obligated) after the signature date of this Agreement and which previously have been discussed with and agreed to by GSK and, so far as the aforementioned Theravance costs are concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount shall not exceed U.S. $2,940,000.   4.2.3 Decisions with Respect to Products.   (a) GSK shall have the sole discretion with respect to Development decisions for Collaboration Products subject to and in accordance with Sections 3.1.5, 3.2.5, and 4.3 .   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that Theravance is about to initiate a Phase I Study in two parts, on TD-3327. The initiation of this study will be approved via the Joint Project Committee in accordance with all other Development activities. Theravance shall be responsible for the routine monitoring of this study and will transfer remaining clinical development responsibility for TD-3327 to the Joint Project Committee on completion of the TD-3327 Phase Ia and Phase Ib Studies.   (c) GSK shall provide the Joint Project Committee with an update report within thirty days of (i) the initiation (i.e., first person dosed) of any Study involving a Collaboration Product, and (ii) the last person dosed/last visit in any Study relating to a Collaboration Product. GSK will provide the Joint Project Committee with a reasonably detailed \"top line results\" report within sixty days following the last person dosed/last visit in any Study involving a Collaboration Product.   4.2.4 Development Timelines. It is hereby acknowledged that GSK's strategic objective is to move one or more of the Collaboration Products into Development at the earliest opportunity. GSK will consult with the Joint Project Committee and will share, modify and further develop all applicable Development Plans and timelines in that forum. It is recognised that success can be optimised by pursuing a number of Collaboration Products through various phases of clinical Development up to the point of Technical or Commercial Failure, and/or until the first Collaboration Product for both single agent and combination therapy achieves regulatory agency approval. At a strategic level, GSK is committed to this objective. However, at an operational level it is recognised that internal and external resources will be constrained from time to time, resulting in the need to prioritise individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products. GSK will use Diligent Efforts to secure the necessary resource and will keep the Joint Project Committee informed on the progress of individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products as part of any changes to Development Plans and timelines.   18\n\n\n\n\n\n  The current objective of the Collaboration is to achieve Marketing Authorization Approval in the US and other Major Markets for a Collaboration Product from one of the eight Pooled Compounds which can be used as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapeutically active components (including but not limited to a Long Acting Inhaled Corticosteroid) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of one or more respiratory diseases by end 2009 for the single agent and 2010 for the first combination product and Development Plans and timelines will be developed and/or refined in an effort to achieve this objective.   4.3 Replacement Compounds. If within two years after the Effective Date, the Development of Collaboration Products containing any two of the Pooled Compounds contributed by a Party is discontinued due to Technical Failure, it will be the option of the Party who contributed the discontinued compounds to discover and offer up to the collaboration two Replacement Compounds as replacements for the discontinued compounds within twelve months following the discontinuation of the second failed compound. For the avoidance of doubt, any such new compound that satisfies the Criteria will automatically be accepted as a Pooled Compound in place of the relevant Party's discontinued compound, subject to Joint Steering Committee approval pursuant to Section 3.1.3(f). Nothing in the foregoing shall preclude either Party from having the option of offering up a Replacement Compound for a Pooled Compound at any time during the period referred to in Section 14.5 (subject to the Criteria being met and Joint Steering Committee approval pursuant to Section 3.1.3(f)).   4.4 Transfer of Data. As soon as practicable but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, the Parties shall determine what data and materials relating to TD-3327 and AMI-15471 are necessary for GSK's Development obligations pursuant to this Article 4, including any technology transfer required for API Compound manufacturing activities contemplated by Article 9, and establish a process for transferring copies of such data and material to GSK (including, to the extent available, in appropriate electronic format) or provide means of access thereto reasonably acceptable to GSK.   4.5 LABA Activity Inside and Outside of the Collaboration.   4.5.1 The intent of the Parties in respect of the Pooled Compounds is that such Pooled Compounds remain exclusive to this Collaboration and, subject to Sections 4.5.2 \u2014 4.5.4 and Article 14 below, no activity in respect of such Pooled Compounds shall be permitted outside of this Agreement.   4.5.2 Subject to Article 14 and to Section 4.5.4, if prior to First Commercial Sale of a GSK Initially Pooled Compound or a GSK Replacement Compound, Development of such compound is discontinued under this Agreement (\"GSK Discontinued Compound\"), all rights in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound shall revert in full to GSK and such GSK Discontinued Compound shall automatically fall outside of this Agreement except that (i) GSK shall thereafter be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical Development work or clinical activity in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound inside the Field for at least four (4) years after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, GSK shall pay to Theravance a royalty on Net Sales of any such GSK Discontinued Compound in accordance with Section 14.9.   4.5.3 Subject to Article 14 and Section 4.5.4, if prior to First Commercial Sale of a Theravance Compound, Development of such compound is discontinued under this Agreement (\"Theravance Discontinued Compound\"), all rights in respect of such Theravance Discontinued Compound shall revert in full to Theravance and such Theravance Discontinued Compound shall   19\n\n\n\n\n\n  automatically fall outside of this Agreement except that (i) Theravance thereafter shall be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical Development work or clinical activity in respect of such Theravance Discontinued Compound inside the Field until after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, Theravance shall pay to GSK a royalty on Net Sales of any such Theravance Discontinued Compound in accordance with Section 14.9.   4.5.4 Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3, for so long as there is one Collaboration Product being Developed under this Agreement, neither Party shall carry out clinical Development inside the Field with any Long Acting B2 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is not a Pooled Compound under this Agreement; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to any compound or product (including new product line extensions and/or re-formulation work) where the original compound or product is, as of the date of signature of this Agreement, already Commercialized.   ARTICLE 5 COMMERCIALIZATION   5.1 Global Marketing Plans.   5.1.1 General. The Joint Project Committee shall be responsible for reviewing and approving a Global Marketing Plan for each Collaboration Product (\"Marketing Plan\").

GSK shall provide the Joint Project Committee reports semi-annually. Such reports shall set forth in summary form the results of GSK's Commercialization activities performed during such semi-annual period in the Major Markets.   5.3.3 Exports to the United States. To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties shall use Diligent Efforts to prevent the Collaboration Products distributed for sale in a particular Country other than the United States from being exported to the United States for sale.   ARTICLE 6 FINANCIAL PROVISIONS   6.1 Signing Payment; Equity Investment; One-Time Fee.   6.1.1 Signing Payment. In partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall on the Effective Date, pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Ten Million United States Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000).   6.1.2 Stock Purchase. On the Effective Date, GSK will purchase 4,000,000 shares of Theravance Series E Preferred Stock at a price of U.S.$10.00 per share for total consideration of Forty Million United States Dollars (U.S. $40,000,000). Such purchase will be made pursuant to the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Schedule 6.1.2.   6.1.3 One-Time Fee for AMI-15471. Within thirty days following receipt by GSK of Theravance's written notification of the decision by Theravance to nominate AMI-15471 as a \"development candidate,\" and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000). AMI-15471 will be declared a development candidate when Theravance (a) completes a study demonstrating lack of activity in the hERG assay (as per the Criteria in Schedule 1.19), and (b) establishes AMI- 15471 in a stable crystalline form.   21\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.1.4 One-Time Fee for Each Theravance New Compound. Within thirty days following the acceptance by the Joint Project Committee or the Joint Steering Committee of each of the two Theravance New Compounds to be contributed to the collaboration pursuant to Section 4.1, and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000) for each such Theravance New Compound.   6.2 Milestone Payments.   6.2.1 General. In further consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties shall also pay to each other the payments set forth below for each such Development milestone referred to therein (each, a \"Development Milestone\"); provided always that each such payment shall be made only one time for each Collaboration Product regardless of how many times such Development Milestones are achieved for such Collaboration Product, and no payment shall be owed for a Development Milestone which is not reached (except that, upon achievement of a Development Milestone for a particular Collaboration Product, any previous Development Milestone for that Collaboration Product for which payment was not made shall be deemed achieved and payment therefore shall be made); provided further that, in the event that more than one Development Milestone is achieved with respect to the same Collaboration Product at one time, then all applicable payments under Section 6.2 shall be made. For example, if TD-3327 as a single-agent Collaboration Product and a LABA/ICS Combination Product that contains TD- 3327 are approved in the same Marketing Authorization Approval, then in addition to the relevant milestone for the single-agent TD-3327 Collaboration Product, the relevant milestone for the LABA/ICS Combination Product shall be paid simultaneously. In the event of termination of development of a particular Collaboration Product and an alternative Collaboration Product replaces such Terminated Collaboration Product then milestone payments for such replacement compound shall not be paid in respect of milestones already achieved by the Terminated Collaboration Product. For example, if development of TD-3327 is terminated and TD-3327 is replaced by a another Collaboration Product which contains a Theravance compound, milestone payments for such replacement compound will only commence for milestones achieved that have not already been achieved by TD-3327.   6.2.2 GSK to Theravance. GSK shall make the following milestone payments to Theravance upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound, and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound:            Milestone\n\n  Amount               Initiation of Phase I *\n\n  U.S.$10 Million   Initiation of Phase IIa**\n\n  U.S.$10 Million   Initiation of Phase IIb**\n\n  U.S.$5 Million               Initiation of Phase III\n\n  U.S.$25 Million     22\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Milestone\n\n  Amount               Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Annual Worldwide Net Sales over U.S.$500 Million for single agent Collaboration Product\n\n\n\nU.S.$10 Million per year for first five years for single agent Collaboration Product\n\n            Annual Worldwide Net Sales over U.S.$500 Million for LABA/ICS Combination Product\n\n\n\nU.S.$20 Million per year for first five years for LABA/ICS Combination Product\n\n\n\n* GSK will make a Phase I milestone payment for both TD-3327 and AMI-15471. The Phase I milestone for TD-3327 is defined as initiation of the methacholine challenge portion of the Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million. The Phase I milestone for AMI-15471 is defined as initiation of the first Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million.   **Phase IIa is defined as initiation of the first single dose study in patients where such study is statistically powered for efficacy based on FEV . Phase IIb is defined as initiation of the first four (4) week dosing, safety and efficacy study in patients.   Other Combination Products that contain a Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is a Theravance Compound are not subject to milestone payments by GSK only if all milestone payments through launch have otherwise been made to Theravance from any Collaboration Product as both a single-agent and as a combination product. The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a Theravance Compound, Theravance be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   If GSK, either individually or as a member of the Joint Steering Committee or Joint Project Committee, discontinues the Development of a single agent Collaboration Product that is a Theravance Compound for reasons other than Technical Failure, and such compound is the LABA in a LABA/ICS Combination Product or in an Other Combination Product, it will compensate Theravance for the unpaid milestone payments otherwise due to Theravance under Section 6.2.2 by adding the unpaid milestone amounts for such discontinued single agent product onto the corresponding milestone payments for the relevant Combination Product.   6.2.3 Theravance to GSK. Theravance shall make the following milestone payments to GSK upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a GSK Compound   23\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n  and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a GSK Compound:                Milestone\n\n  Amount               Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million     Other Combination Products that contain a Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is a GSK Compound are not subject to milestone payments by Theravance only if all milestone payments through launch have otherwise been made to GSK from any Collaboration Product as both a single-agent and as a combination product. The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound, GSK be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   6.2.4 Notification and Payment. In the event a Party achieves a Development Milestone, such Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days after the achievement of each such Development Milestone, notify the other Party in writing of the achievement of same. For all Development Milestones achieved, each Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after notification of the achievement of each such Development Milestone, remit payment to the other Party for such Development Milestone.   6.3 Payment of Royalties on Net Sales.   6.3.1 Royalty on Single-Agent Collaboration Products and LABA/ICS Combination Products.   Within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter , GSK shall pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:        On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales up to and including U.S. $3 Billion:\n\n  15   %                   On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales greater than U.S. $3 Billion:\n\n  5   %     it being understood that Net Sales of a single agent Collaboration Product will be combined with Net Sales of a LABA/ICS Combination Product for purposes of the foregoing royalty calculation.   The quarterly royalty payments made under this Section 6.3.1 may be based on estimated Net Sales. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall calculate the actual amount of Net Sales for the previous Calendar Quarter and either credit or debit the difference between such actual and projected amount on the succeeding Calendar Quarter's royalty payment to Theravance. As soon as practical following the end of each Calendar Month, but in no event later than the 10 business day of the following month, GSK will provide Theravance with an estimate of Net Sales for such Calendar Month.   24\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\n  The royalties payable under this Section 6.3 shall be paid on a Country-by-Country basis from the date of first commercial sale of each Collaboration Product in a particular Country for the Term of the Collaboration.   6.3.2 Royalty Adjustment. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 12% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance only contributes one Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 10% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance fails to contribute any Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. Nothing in the foregoing shall affect other royalties owed under this Agreement.   6.3.3 Royalties on Other Collaboration Products Launched After the LABA/ICS Combination Product. For any Other Collaboration Product launched after the LABA/ICS Combination Product, GSK shall within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:\n\nAnnual Net Sales\n\n\n\nPercentage Royalty\n\n                  Up to U.S.$750 Million\n\n  6.5   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$1.25 Billion\n\n  8.0   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$2.25 Billion\n\n  9.0   %                   Net Sales exceeding U.S.$2.25 Billion\n\n  10.0   %     For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the royalty set forth in this Section 6.3.3 shall only be effective if GSK has launched and is selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product that is subject to the royalties under Section 6.3.1. If GSK is not selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product, then the royalty set forth in Section 6.3.1 shall apply to the first Other Combination Product launched by GSK, provided such Other Combination Product does not contain a product in-licensed by GSK; if such Other Combination Product contains a product in-licensed by GSK, then the royalty payable to Theravance will be reduced by 50% of any running royalties paid to a Third Party, provided that in no case will the royalty payable to Theravance be less than set forth in this Section 6.3.3.   25\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.4 Royalty Responsibilities; Net Sales Reports.   6.4.1 Payments to Third Parties.   (a) If, as a result of a settlement approved by both Parties or as a result of a final non-appealable judgment, GSK is required to pay any amounts to a Third Party directly because using or selling a Theravance Compound is found to infringe the rights of such Third Party, GSK shall deduct fifty percent (50%) of any such amount paid to such Third Party from the royalties otherwise due Theravance for the Collaboration Product containing such Theravance Compound, provided in no event shall such reduction reduce the royalties otherwise payable to Theravance during any Calendar Year by more than fifty percent (50%); provided, further, that any excess deduction shall be carried over into subsequent years of this Agreement until the full deduction is taken.   (b) GSK shall pay any amounts owed to a Third Party as a result of the use of GSK Patents or GSK Know-How with respect to sales of Collaboration Products and shall not deduct any of such amounts from the royalties due Theravance. The foregoing is subject to Section 6.3.3.   6.4.2 Net Sales Report. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall submit to Theravance a written report setting forth Net Sales in the Territory on a Country-by-Country and Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis during such Calendar Quarter, total royalty payments due Theravance, relevant market share data and any payments made to any Third Party pursuant to Section 6.4.1(a) (each a \"Net Sales Report\").   6.5 GAAP. All financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring in the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring outside the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.   6.6 Currencies. Monetary conversion from the currency of a foreign country in which Collaboration Product is sold into US Dollars shall be calculated in accordance with either (a) the methodology referred to in GSK's then current Corporate Finance Reporting Policy or (b) as otherwise may be mutually agreed by the Parties. The following summarizes GSK's current methodology applied in accordance with its current Corporate Finance Reporting System: the cumulative year-to-date Average Rates are calculated by determining the average of (i) the preceding 31st December Spot Rate plus (ii) the Closing Spot Rates of the relevant months to date using the exact figures provided by the Reuters 2000 download. (By way of example, the Average Rate for the five months from January, 2002 to May, 2002 would be computed by taking the sum of the Spot Rates for the preceding 31st December, 2001, plus the month-end Spot Rates for the five months to May, 2002, divided by six).   6.7 Manner of Payments. All sums due to either Party under this Section 6 shall be payable in United States Dollars by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as each of GSK and Theravance shall designate. GSK shall notify Theravance as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to Theravance at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer. Theravance shall notify GSK as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to GSK at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer.   26\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.8 Interest on Late Payments. If either Theravance or GSK shall fail to make a timely payment pursuant to this Article 6, any such payment that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due under this Agreement shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the average one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for the United States Dollar as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, effective for the first date on which payment was delinquent and calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue or, if such rate is not regularly published, as published in such source as the Joint Steering Committee agrees.   6.9 Tax Withholding.   6.9.1 Any taxes, levies or other duties (\"Taxes\") paid or required to be withheld under the appropriate local tax laws by one of the Parties (\"Withholding Party\") on account of monies payable to the other Party under this Agreement shall, subject to Sections 6.9.2 and 6.9.3, be deducted from the amount of monies otherwise payable to the other Party under this Agreement. The Withholding Party shall secure and send to the other Party within a reasonable period of time proof of any such Taxes paid or required to be withheld by Withholding Party for the benefit of the other Party.   6.9.2 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Agreement, then GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate owes to the relevant tax authority provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld (\"Creditable Taxes\") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance.   6.9.3 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Section 6.3, then such taxes may be withheld by GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate up to a limit of five percent (5%) of the relevant payment.

All costs and expenses incurred in connection with performing any such audit shall be paid by Theravance unless the audit discloses at least a five percent (5%) shortfall, in which case the Recording Party will bear the full cost of the audit for such Calendar Year. Theravance will be entitled to recover any shortfall in payments due to it as determined by such audit, plus interest thereon calculated in accordance with Section 6.8, or alternatively shall have the right to offset and deduct any such shortfall in payments due to it against payments Theravance is otherwise required to make to the Reporting Party under this Agreement.

Subject to Sections 12.4 and 13.2, GSK shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Theravance and its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors and assigns from and against all Claims of Third Parties, and all associated Losses, to the extent arising out of (a) GSK's negligence or willful misconduct in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, (b) a breach by GSK of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or (c) the manufacture, use, handling, storage, marketing, sale, distribution or other disposition of Collaboration Products by GSK, its Affiliates, agents or sublicensees, except to the extent such losses result from the negligence or willful misconduct of Theravance.   12.2 Indemnification by Theravance. Subject to Sections 12.4 and 13.2, Theravance shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless GSK and its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors and assigns from and against all Claims of Third Parties, and all associated Losses, to the extent arising out of (a) Theravance's negligence or willful misconduct in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b) a breach by Theravance of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement.   35\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.3 Procedure for Indemnification.   12.3.1 Notice. Each Party will notify promptly the other in writing if it becomes aware of a Claim (actual or potential) by any Third Party (a \"Third Party Claim\") for which indemnification may be sought by that Party and will give such information with respect thereto as the other Party shall reasonably request. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any Party for which such Party may seek an indemnity under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as the case may be (the \"Indemnified Party\"), the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission or statement concerning such Third Party Claim, but shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") orally and in writing and the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to any Third Party Claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified Party or any failure by such Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim.   12.3.2 Defense of Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or, if local procedural rules or laws do not permit the same, elects to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall be entitled to do so provided it gives notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the written notice from the Indemnified Party of the potentially indemnifiable Third Party Claim (the \"Litigation Condition\"). The Indemnifying Party expressly agrees the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for satisfying and discharging any award made to or settlement reached with the Third Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without prejudice to any provision in this Agreement or right at law which will allow the Indemnifying Party subsequently to recover any amount from the Indemnified Party to the extent the liability under such settlement or award was attributable to the Indemnified Party. Subject to compliance with the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed) to represent the Indemnified Party and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is being managed and/or controlled by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in which the Indemnified Party is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the Litigation Condition is not met, then neither Party shall have the right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each Party's own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party may at any subsequent time during the pendency of the relevant Third Party Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defense of the relevant Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in relation to the defense of such Third Party Claim from   36\n\n\n\n\n\n  the inception of the Third Party Claim until the date the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense or control thereof.   12.4 Assumption of Defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with respect to the Indemnified Party, upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.4, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of liability under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as applicable, solely for such Third Party Claim and related Losses.   12.5 Insurance. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, GSK shall obtain and/or maintain at its sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured arrangements) in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities. Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the Collaboration Products. GSK shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to Theravance upon request.   ARTICLE 13 PATENTS   13.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents.   13.1.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Theravance Patents. Theravance shall have the exclusive right and the obligation to (subject to Theravance's election not to file, prosecute, or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.4) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file, prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all Theravance Patents and related applications. Theravance shall consult with GSK prior to abandoning any Theravance Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. Theravance shall regularly advise GSK of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at GSK's request, shall provide GSK with copies of all documentation concerning such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, Theravance shall solicit GSK's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and Theravance shall take into account GSK's reasonable comments related thereto; provided, however, Theravance shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to any Theravance Patent. Within the priority period, Theravance shall agree with GSK regarding the countries outside the United States in which corresponding applications should be filed (\"OUS Filings\"). It is presumed that a corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty (\"PCT\") application will be filed unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Theravance shall effect filing of all such applications within the priority period.   Subject to Section 13.1.4, Theravance shall be responsible for all costs incurred in the United States in connection with procuring Theravance Patents, including applications preparation, filing fees, prosecution, maintenance and all costs associated with reexamination and   37\n\n\n\n\n\n  interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and United States Courts. GSK shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Theravance after the Effective Date that are associated with procuring corresponding OUS patents, including without limitation PCT and individual country filing fees, translations, maintenance, annuities, and protest proceedings. For all such OUS patent applications, Theravance will invoice GSK on a quarterly basis beginning April 1, 2003, setting forth all such expenses incurred. Reimbursement will be made to Theravance in United States Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice by GSK. GSK will within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date identify the GSK representative that should receive such invoices from Theravance. GSK's obligations hereunder are in addition to any obligations of GSK under Section 13.1.2(b)   13.1.2 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents Covering Joint Inventions.   (a) For Patents covering Joint Inventions, the Parties shall agree, without prejudice to ownership, which Party shall have the right to prepare and file a priority patent application, and prosecute such application(s) and maintain any patents derived therefrom, with the Parties equally sharing the reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such priority patent application. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to obtain any export licenses that might be required for such activities. Should the agreed upon Party elect not to prepare and/or file any such priority patent application, it shall (i) provide the other Party with written notice as soon as reasonably possible after making such election but in any event no later than sixty (60) days before the other Party would be faced with a possible loss of rights, (ii) give the other Party the right, at the other Party's discretion and sole expense, to prepare and file the priority application(s), and (iii) offer reasonable assistance in connection with such preparation and filing at no cost to the other Party except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the agreed upon Party in rendering such assistance. The other Party, at its discretion and cost, shall prosecute such application(s) and maintain sole ownership of any patents derived therefrom.   (b) Within nine (9) months after the filing date of a priority application directed to an Invention, the Party filing the priority application shall request that the other Party identify those non-priority, non-PCT (\"foreign\") Countries in which the other Party desires that the Party filing the priority application file corresponding patent applications. Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the other Party of such request from the Party filing the priority application, the other Party shall provide to the Party filing the priority application a written list of such foreign countries in which the other Party wishes to effect corresponding foreign patent applications filings. The Parties will then attempt to agree on the particular countries in which such applications will be filed, provided that in the event agreement is not reached, the application will be filed in the disputed as well as the non-disputed countries (all such filings referred to hereinafter as \"Designated Foreign Filings\"). Thereafter, within twelve (12) months after the filing date of the priority application, the Party filing the priority application shall effect all such Designated Foreign Filings. It is presumed unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, that a corresponding PCT application will be filed designating all PCT member countries. As to each Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application, GSK shall bear the costs for the filing and prosecutions of such Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application (including entering national phase in all agreed countries). Should the Party filing the priority application not agree to file or cause to be filed a Designated Foreign Filing, the other Party will have the right to effect such Designated Foreign Filing in its name.   38\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) Should the filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) no longer wish to prosecute and/or maintain any patent application or patent resulting from such application, the filing Party shall (i) provide the non-filing Party with written notice of its wish no later than sixty (60) days before the patent or patent applications would otherwise become abandoned, (ii) give the non-filing Party the right, at the non-filing Party's election and sole expense, to prosecute and/or maintain such patent or patent application, and (iii) offer reasonable assistance to the non- filing Party in connection with such prosecution and/or maintenance at no cost to the non-filing Party except for reimbursement of the filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (d) Should the non-filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(c) not wish to incur its share of preparation, filing, prosecution and/or maintenance costs for a patent application filed pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) or patents derived therefrom, it shall (i) provide the filing Party with written notice of its wish, and (ii) continue to offer reasonable assistance to the filing Party in connection with such prosecution or maintenance at no cost to the filing Party except for reimbursement of the non-filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (e) The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation and prosecution of all patent applications filed under Section 13.1.2(a) and 13.1.2(b), including obtaining and executing necessary powers of attorney and assignments by the named inventors, providing relevant technical reports to the filing Party concerning the invention disclosed in such patent application, obtaining execution of such other documents which shall be needed in the filing and prosecution of such patent applications, and, as requested, updating each other regarding the status of such patent applications.   13.1.3 Prosecution and Maintenance of GSK Patents. GSK shall have the exclusive right and obligation to (subject to GSK's election not to file, prosecute or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.5) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file and prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all GSK Patents and related applications. Consistent with Section 2.3.3, GSK will consult with Theravance within the priority period for any patent application that is material to this Agreement concerning Countries in which corresponding applications will be filed. In the event the Parties can not agree, GSK shall make the final decision. GSK shall consult with Theravance prior to abandoning any GSK Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. GSK shall regularly advise Theravance of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at Theravance's request, shall provide Theravance with copies of documentation relating to such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, GSK shall solicit Theravance's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and GSK shall take into account Theravance's reasonable comments relating thereto; provided that GSK shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to a GSK Patent.   13.1.4 GSK Step-In Rights. If Theravance elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the Theravance Patents or claims encompassed by such Theravance Patents necessary for GSK to exercise its rights hereunder in any Country, Theravance shall give GSK notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such Theravance Patents, or such claims encompassed by   39\n\n\n\n\n\n  such Theravance Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and GSK shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such Theravance Patents in such Country.   13.1.5 Theravance Step-In Rights. If GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the GSK Patents or claims encompassed by such GSK Patents necessary for Theravance to exercise its license rights hereunder in any Country, GSK shall give Theravance notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such GSK Patents, or such claims encompassed by such GSK Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and Theravance shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such GSK Patents in such Country. In the event that GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain GSK Patents or claims that would affect the royalty owed Theravance pursuant to Section 6.3, GSK shall reimburse Theravance for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Theravance in connection with Theravance exercising its Step-In Rights under this Section.   13.1.6 Execution of Documents by Agents. Each of the Parties shall execute or have executed by its appropriate agents such documents as may be necessary to obtain, perfect or maintain any Patent Rights filed or to be filed pursuant to this Agreement, and shall cooperate with the other Party so far as reasonably necessary with respect to furnishing all information and data in its possession reasonably necessary to obtain or maintain such Patent Rights.   13.1.7 Patent Term Extensions. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in gaining patent term extension where applicable to Collaboration Products. The Joint Steering Committee shall determine which patents the Parties shall endeavor to have extended. All filings for such extension will be made by the Party to whom the patent is assigned after consultation with the other Party. In the event the Joint Steering Committee can not agree, the Party who is assigned the compound patent covering the LABA in the Collaboration Product will make the decision.   13.2 Patent Infringement.   13.2.1 Infringement Claims. With respect to any and all Claims instituted by Third Parties against Theravance or GSK or any of their respective Affiliates for patent infringement involving the manufacture, use, license, marketing or sale of a Collaboration Product in the United States during the Term (each, a \"Patent Infringement Claim\") as applicable, Theravance and GSK will assist one another and cooperate in the defense and settlement of such Patent Infringement Claims at the other Party's request.   13.2.2 Infringement of Theravance Patents. In the event that Theravance or GSK becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a Theravance Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing (a \"Patent Infringement Notice\"). Theravance will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that Theravance does not undertake such an infringement action, upon Theravance's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, GSK shall be permitted to do so in Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's name and on Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's behalf. If Theravance has consented to an infringement action but GSK is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then GSK may join Theravance as party-plaintiff. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance may be represented in   40\n\n\n\n\n\n  such action by attorneys of its own choice and its own expense with GSK taking the lead in such action.   13.2.3 Infringement of GSK Patents. In the event that GSK or Theravance becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a GSK Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing. GSK will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that GSK does not undertake such an infringement action, upon GSK's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, Theravance shall be permitted to do so in GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's name and on GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's behalf. If GSK has consented to an infringement action but Theravance is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then Theravance may join GSK as a party-plaintiff. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK may be represented in such action by attorneys of its own choice and at its own expense, with Theravance taking the lead in such action.   13.3 Notice of Certification. GSK and Theravance each shall immediately give notice to the other of any certification filed under the \"U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984\" (or its foreign equivalent) claiming that a GSK Patent or a Theravance Patent is invalid or that infringement will not arise from the manufacture, use or sale of any Collaboration Product by a Third Party (\"Hatch-Waxman Certification\").   13.3.1 Notice. If a Party decides not to bring infringement proceedings against the entity making such a certification, such Party shall give notice to the other Party of its decision not to bring suit within twenty-one (21) days after receipt of notice of such certification.   13.3.2 Option. Such other Party then may, but is not required to, bring suit against the entity that filed the certification.   13.3.3 Name of Party. Any suit by Theravance or GSK shall either be in the name of Theravance or in the name of GSK, (or any Affiliate) or jointly in the name of Theravance and GSK (or any Affiliate) , as may be required by law.   13.4 Assistance. For purposes of this Article 13, the Party not bringing suit shall execute such legal papers necessary for the prosecution of such suit as may be reasonably requested by the Party bringing suit. The out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Party bringing suit shall be reimbursed first out of any damages or other monetary awards recovered in favor of GSK or Theravance. The documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the other Party shall then be reimbursed out of any remaining damages or other monetary awards. The Party initiating and prosecuting the action to completion will retain any remaining damages or other monetary awards following such reimbursements.   13.5 Settlement. No settlement or consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of a suit under this Article may be entered into without the joint written consent of GSK and Theravance (which consent will not be withheld unreasonably).   41\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE 14 TERM AND TERMINATION   14.1 Term and Expiration of Term. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end upon expiration of the Term, unless terminated early as contemplated hereunder. Unless terminated early under this Article 14, the licenses granted by Theravance to GSK pursuant to Section 2.1 with respect to the Collaboration Products shall be considered fully-paid and shall become non-exclusive upon expiration of the Term.   14.2 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may, without prejudice to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, terminate this Agreement subject to Section 14.10 in the event that the other Party (as used in this subsection, the \"Breaching Party\") shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations. The Breaching Party shall, if such breach can be cured, have sixty (60) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default (or, if such default cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party must commence and diligently continue actions to cure such default during such 60-day period). Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such 60-day period unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such 60-day period (or, if such default is capable of being cured but cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently continued actions to cure such default provided always that, in such instance, such cure must have occurred within one hundred twenty (120) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default).   14.3 GSK Right to Terminate Development of a Collaboration Product. On a Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis, and at any time during Development and prior to First Commercial Sale of the applicable Collaboration Product, GSK shall have the right to terminate Development of such Collaboration Product (upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice) for reasons of Technical Failure or Commercial Failure following communication to, and assessment of such proposed termination by, the Joint Project Committee and Joint Steering Committee (in which case such Collaboration Product shall be referred to as a \"Terminated Development Collaboration Product\").

For the avoidance of doubt, a Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product can be any of the following: (i) a single agent LABA Collaboration Product and/or (ii) a LABA/ICS Combination Product and/or (iii) an Other Combination Product.   42\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.5 Termination of the Agreement Due to Discontinuation of Development of All Collaboration Products and All Pooled Compounds . Any time following the third anniversary of the Effective Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 14.10, upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice if Development of all Collaboration Products and all Pooled Compounds have been discontinued for Technical Failure and/or Commercial Failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) Development of all Collaboration Products and all Pooled Compounds (including any Replacement Compounds) has ceased for at least three (3) months, (ii) all such termination and/or discontinuance decisions have been validly approved by the Joint Steering Committee, and (iii) both parties have provided written notice to the other that such party does not intend to contribute any additional Replacement Compounds to the collaboration, then either Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 14.10, upon the provision of ninety (90) days written notice.   14.6 Effects of Termination.   14.6.1 Effect of Termination for Material Breach.   (a) Material Breach by Theravance. In the event this Agreement is terminated by GSK pursuant to Section 14.2 for material breach by Theravance, all licenses granted by Theravance to GSK under this Agreement shall survive, subject to GSK's continued obligation to pay milestones and royalties to Theravance hereunder. In such event, GSK shall retain all of its rights to bring an action against Theravance for damages and any other available remedies in law or equity, and shall be entitled to set-off against any monies payable to Theravance hereunder all amounts GSK reasonably believes constitute its damages incurred by such breach, subject to final judicial resolution or settlement. Also, Theravance shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to GSK copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound and return to GSK, or destroy at GSK's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of GSK (provided that Theravance may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of GSK for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).   (b) Material Breach By GSK. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Theravance pursuant to Section 14.2 for material breach by GSK:   (i) GSK shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to Theravance copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Theravance Compounds and return to Theravance, or destroy at Theravance's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of Theravance (provided that GSK may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of Theravance for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).

If GSK terminates a Collaboration Product at any time after initiation of the first Phase III Study concerning such Collaboration Product, and Development of all other Collaboration Products and Pooled Compounds have been discontinued for Technical Failure and/or Commercial Failure, then at the sole election of Theravance, the following shall apply:   (a) GSK shall, at its sole expense, promptly transfer to Theravance copies of all data, reports, records and materials in its possession or control that relate to the Theravance Compounds and return to Theravance, or destroy at Theravance's request, all relevant records and materials in its possession or control containing Confidential Information of Theravance (provided that GSK may keep one copy of such Confidential Information of Theravance for archival purposes only in accordance with Section 10.1).   (b) GSK shall, at its sole expense, transfer to Theravance, or shall cause its designee(s) to transfer to Theravance, ownership of all regulatory filings made or filed for the Terminated Development Collaboration Product that contains a LABA as a single agent (to the extent that any are held in GSK's or such designee(s)'s name), such transfer to be as permitted by any Third Party licenses or other such prior rights and applicable Laws and regulations, otherwise GSK shall cooperate as necessary to permit Theravance to exercise its rights hereunder.   (c) Theravance shall have the non-exclusive right to access, use and cite in any regulatory filing any data relating to formulation of a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   (d) For such Terminated Development Collaboration Product (excluding the non-LABA component of a LABA/ICS Combination Product and/or Other Combination Product and GSK's Diskus delivery device and any information directed thereto), GSK shall grant to Theravance the appropriate licenses in the Territory under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know- How related to the LABA compound, dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable, to enable Theravance to Develop and Commercialize the Terminated Development Collaboration Product in the Field.   44\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) In the event of a Change in Control of Theravance prior to termination by GSK under Section 14.3, none of the provisions under this Section 14.6.2 shall survive as they pertain to any Collaboration Product other than a Theravance compound as a single agent LABA.   14.6.3 Effect of Termination by GSK of a Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product. The provisions of this Section 14.6.3 shall apply only where a Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product is not being or has not been replaced by an alternative Collaboration Product under this Agreement and provided that, in GSK's reasonable good faith judgment, exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 (which such rights or activities shall include access to a GSK compound and/or GSK proprietary formulations or devices including Diskus, (collectively \"GSK Property\")) will not materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of such GSK Property. GSK will use reasonable efforts to assist Theravance in locating a mutually acceptable Third Party to carry out the rights and activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3. Subject to the foregoing:   (a) If GSK terminates a Collaboration Product after First Commercial Sale of such Collaboration Product in one or more of the Major Market Countries, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at its sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to commercialize such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in any of such Major Market Countries where it has been terminated.   (b) If GSK terminates Commercialization of a Collaboration Product in all Countries of the Territory following the first commercial sale in any Country of the Territory, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at it sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to Commercialise such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in the Territory.   (c) Subject to Section 14.6.3(a), GSK shall grant to Theravance the appropriate licenses in the Territory (or in the case of a Country-by-Country termination, in the relevant Countries) under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How to enable Theravance by itself and/or through one or more Third Party sublicensees, to Commercialize the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product. GSK shall also provide Theravance with all such information and data which GSK, or its sublicensees reasonably have available in such Country, for example access to drug master file, clinical data and the like, and shall execute such instruments as Theravance reasonably requests, to enable Theravance to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to market such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country and for any other lawful purpose related to Commercialization of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country.   (d) In the event Theravance exercises its rights under Section 14.6.3(a) and (b) above, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a separate commercialization and supply agreement for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product which shall ensure that, based on commercially reasonable terms   45\n\n\n\n\n\n  (recognizing the Commercialized status of the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product), Theravance has a continuous and uninterrupted supply of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product, for a suitable period of time to enable Theravance to secure Third Party supply.   (e) In the event of a Change in Control of Theravance, prior to termination by GSK under Section 14.4, none of the provisions under this Section 14.6.3 shall survive as they pertain to any Collaboration Product other than to a single agent LABA, its dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable; and the Parties will meet in good faith to explore other potential commercial options e.g. use of one or more Third Parties for possible continued Commercialisation of such Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product if it is a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   (f) If GSK, in the exercise of its reasonable good faith judgment, determines that exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 will materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of GSK Property, then GSK shall grant to Theravance, for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product (excluding the non-LABA component of a Combination Product and/or Other Combination Product and GSK's Diskus delivery device and any information directed thereto), the appropriate licenses in the Territory under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How related to the LABA compound, dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable, to enable Theravance to Commercialize a product containing the LABA Compound in the Field.   14.6.4 Effect of Termination of the Agreement Due to Discontinuation of Development Prior to First Commercial Sale of All Collaboration Products and All Pooled Compounds. In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.5, the following shall occur:   (i) Return of Materials.

(ii) Transfer of Regulatory Filings. GSK shall, at its sole expense, transfer to Theravance, or shall cause its designee(s) to transfer to Theravance, ownership of all regulatory filings made or filed for any Terminated Development Collaboration Product (to the extent that any are held in GSK's or such designee(s)'s name), but only where the Terminated Collaboration Product contains a Theravance Compound as a single agent and such transfer to be as permitted   46\n\n\n\n\n\n  by applicable Laws and regulations. GSK, at its sole discretion, shall also give due consideration to transferring to Theravance any additional regulatory filings for a Terminated Development Collaboration Product which contains a Theravance Compound as a Combination Product.   (iii) License Rights. All licenses granted by Theravance to GSK with respect to the Collaboration Products under this Agreement shall terminate.   (iv) Stock Return.

Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners.\n\n  iv)  To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement.

POST-TERMINATION COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  a)   Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows:\n\n       i)   Excite@Home will email Program Members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will\n\nSource: INVENDA CORP, S-1/A, 8/28/2000\n\n\n\n\n\n            continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.\n\n       ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.\n\n       iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.\n\n       iv)  Any such communications will be subject to Excite@Home's                then-current privacy policy.\n\n  b)   In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section           16.a.v. due to e-centives' acquisition by an Excite@Home Named           Competitor, or by an entity controlling or controlled by an           Excite@Home Named Competitor, e-centives or its assigns or designates           may not contact any Users for whom User Data has been provided           pursuant to this Agreement, excluding those that have opted out in           accordance with Section 5(a) of Exhibit D. In the event of such           termination, e-centives will not be eligible for any refund of           pre-termination payments made to Excite@Home.\n\n                                    19\n\n20 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n  a)   The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'           obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or           confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is           no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or           threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks,           service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party           will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other           available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any attempt         to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and         void.\n\n  c) Notice. Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered         by personal delivery, express courier, confirmed facsimile, confirmed         email or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and         will be deemed given upon personal delivery, one (1) day after deposit         with express courier, upon confirmation of receipt of facsimile or email         or five (5) days after deposit in the mail.

The parties are independent contractors and will have no         power or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility         on behalf of each other. This Agreement will not be construed to create         or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.\n\n  e) Audit Rights.

In the case of inaccurate and/or outdated      User Data, the providing party shall immediately provide accurate User Data      and/or updated User Data (to the extent such party has updated User Data.\n\nf)   Force Majeure.  Any delay in or failure of performance by either party      under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and      will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence beyond the      reasonable control of such party including, but not limited to, acts of      God, power outages and governmental restrictions.\n\ng)   Severability.

This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement      between the parties with respect to the subject matter or related matters      hereof, superseding any prior agreements and communications (both written      and oral) regarding such subject matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the      Sponsorship Agreement effective on March 5, 1999 that currently is in      force between the two parties to this Agreement shall remain in force, on      an interim basis only, and will terminate at the end of the calendar month      that the Co-Branded Application launches on the Excite@Home Shopping      service without further compensation from either party.\n\ni)   Waiver.  The failure of either Party to require performance by the other      Party of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the full right to      require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by      either Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement be taken or      held to be a waiver of the provision itself.\n\nj)   Modification.

The                remaining 70% of such first pages, along with subsequent pages                within each category, the offer placement locations will be                split 50%/50% between Excite@Home and e-centives and will be                served in an alternating order.\n\n  b)   For the second and any following pages presented within any shopping           category area, half of the offer placement positions will be           allocated to Excite@Home and the other half will be allocated to           e-centives and the position of said placements on the page shall be           random.\n\n                                    30\n\n31 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

For any branding at the merchant subject to           final merchant approval, e-centives shall use commercially reasonable           efforts to ensure that both Excite@Home and e-centives branding           elements are present.\n\n  c)   Both traditional e-centives offers and Excite@Home e-centives offers           will contain e-centives branding elements within an application that           is otherwise Excite@Home branded.\n\n  d)   The Co-Branded Application shall conform to Excite@Home Third-Party           Application standards, including:\n\n       i)   Page weight;\n\n       ii)  Presence of advertising banners and/or sponsorship placements                served by Excite@Home/MatchLogic at Excite@Home's exclusive                option;\n\n       iii) Color, fonts, layout, design standards, header, footer,                navigational elements, tabbing metaphors, etc.;\n\n       iv)  Navigational elements directing traffic to non-e-centives content                (e.g., Excite@Home Mail and other Excite@Home Shopping                destinations);\n\n       v)   Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards may change over                the Term of this Agreement.

Any such required changes shall be reasonable                and shall be materially similar to changes required of other                applications and application providers subject to Excite@Home's                Third-Party Application Standards.\n\n  e)   The Co-Branded Application shall be designed to appear to the customer           as being Excite@Home; analogs to the goal would be Excite@Home's           sports content area at http://www.excite.com/sports, as it appears on           the Effective Date of this Agreement (see Exhibit C), which is served           by a third-party firm but carries only Excite@Home messaging cues.\n\n                                    31\n\n32 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

OFFER HIERARCHY SYNCHRONIZATION\n\n  a)   e-centives does not need to adopt Excite@Home's directory structure           but must use similar categorization methodology. For example, Autos           and Electronics may be categories at the same level in the hierarchy,           but Autos and Cameras would not be at the same level.\n\n  b)   e-centives must map to Excite@Home's Shopping directory hierarchy,           which may change from time to time during the Term of this Agreement.\n\n  c)   e-centives must adopt Excite@Home's naming conventions (e.g.           Excite@Home's \"Autos\" label vs. e-centives' \"Automotive\" label).\n\n  d)   e-centives must provide product and/or offer search capabilities that           are comparable to Excite Network offerings, including local (zip           code) and off-line redemption.

If Excite@Home does not sell such emails, or           all positions within such emails, then e-centives may do so.\n\n  c)   Excite@Home and e-centives shall share equally all net revenue from           such offers, defined as gross revenue minus third-party serving           costs, which shall not exceed $0.01 per email piece delivered.\n\n4.

Each party           shall assume its own costs in both sending outbound email and in           providing necessary reporting and data to the other party.\n\n5.

OFFERS\n\n a)  The parties will work together to develop mutually agreed upon modules         designed to promote the Co-Branded Application, which may appear on the         Excite.com homepage for some Users.\n\n b)  At its discretion, Excite@Home may include up to five rotating links on         the My Excite Start Page (\"MESP\"). At Excite@Home's discretion,         Excite@Home may include Excite@Home exclusive e-centives offers, non-         exclusive e-centives offers may also get rotation on MESP, or general         calls to action to the Co-Branded Application.\n\n c)  At Excite@Home's discretion, links may be included in the \"My Services\"         module. All decisions regarding this module remain Excite@Home's,         including but not limited to the name and relative placement of the         module on MESP.

OFFER CATEGORIES\n\n a)  This Section applies to the publicly accessible narrowband offering from         Excite@Home, currently available at http://www.excite.com.\n\n b)  Excite@Home intends to use a randomization function to surface offers on         MESP in order to provide category specification by user and to support         dynamic content delivery for each server-refreshed page view. This         technique will support all e-centives categories and personalized user         category filtering, but will not support offers that can appear in         multiple categories or offer weighting.\n\n c)  Of all e-centives implementation links on MESP, any single category can         have only one link placement.\n\n d)  For a category to be surfaced, there must be three unique offers in that         category. The minimum of three offers per category must remain fresh;         if more than one week has elapsed without new offers being available         then a status message indicating no new offers in the category selected         will appear.\n\n e)  To prevent multiple appearances of a single offer on one MESP page view,         every offer must be tagged to only one e-centives category.\n\n                                    37    38 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

For clarification, Network's Advertising Revenue shall not include accounts receivable or Network's Transactional Revenue.   \"Network's Transactional Revenue\" means the gross dollar amount of revenue actually received by Network (e.g., net of the cost of goods and services and all fulfillment costs associated with the sale of such goods and services) from (i) the sale of products and services by way of direct response telephone orders from the toll-free number included on the Service, and (ii) e-commerce sales of products and services by or on behalf of Network over the Internet originating from Network's website (i.e., URL www.thetubetv.com or any replacement or supplemental URL) or Affiliate's website, in all cases, originating from within the Zip Codes in the DMA of the Station(s) transmitting the Service, and from Zip Codes in the DMA of any MVPD(s) that carry a Station if, at the time of the sale, Network does not have an affiliation with a Broadcast Station that is transmitting the Service and whose Licensed Community is located in such DMA.     \"Primary Feed\" means the audio and video presentations of each Station's primary one-way over-the-air digital television signal (which signal may be in either standard definition or high definition television (as such term is defined by the Advanced Television Systems Committee) format).   \"Promotional Spots\" has the meaning set forth in Section 8(a).   \"Service\" means the television programming service provided by Network as defined in the preamble to this Agreement.   \"Station(s)\" means a Broadcast Television station licensed to Affiliate or a subsidiary of Affiliate by the FCC that provides or is capable of providing the Service to the Licensed Community that it is licensed to serve.   \"TV Households\" means the number of television households in a given DMA as determined by Nielsen Media Research, Inc.

If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least six (6) months before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional four (4) -year period (\"Renewal Term\").   (c) If the Term is renewed as described in Section 2(b), Network and Affiliate will negotiate exclusively and in good faith concerning further renewal of this Agreement upon mutually-agreed terms and conditions; provided, that unless Network and Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the exclusive negotiation period will end six (6) months before the expiration of the Term.   3.GRANT OF RIGHTS; ACQUIRED STATIONS:   (a) Network hereby grants to Affiliate the exclusive right via Broadcast Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such exclusive right and the obligation during the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission facilities of each Station identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the \"Licensed Community\"), for receipt by TV Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located, as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service. Affiliate shall telecast the Service from each Station's origination transmitter and antenna for free over-the-air television reception, and by other customary means used by each Station to transmit its signal in its DMA (e.g., FCC-licensed translators and fiber or microwave connections to MVPDs). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Affiliate shall have the right to authorize, and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, carriage of the Service's signal by MVPDs that retransmit digital Broadcast Television signals in the DMA of each Station that transmits the Service, which Service signal shall be transmitted by Affiliate together with the Primary Feed. Affiliate's failure to obtain such carriage by any MVPD shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement. Affiliate shall endeavor to secure carriage of the Service by MVPDs on the most highly penetrated level of digital service. Further, Affiliate shall have the right to authorize carriage of the Service's signal on a nonexclusive basis by MVPDs that retransmit a Station's Primary Feed outside the Station's DMA, and that are carrying the Station's analog signal as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, (1) Affiliate shall not authorize an MVPD to deliver the Service to subscribers outside the Station's DMA in areas in which the Station, pursuant to FCC rules, is not \"significantly viewed,\" if the MVPD receives the Station's signal via satellite, and (2) any agreement by Affiliate for out-of-DMA carriage of the Service shall require that the MVPD's authorization from Affiliate to carry the Service terminate upon the initial over- the-air transmission of the Service by a Broadcast Television station whose Licensed Community is located within the DMA of the pertinent MVPD system if such station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service in such DMA. Network shall provide Affiliate with at least 45 days' advance written notice of such Broadcast Television's station's initial over-the-air transmission of the Service and Affiliate shall provide such notice to the pertinent MVPD. In the event Affiliate owns more than one Station in any DMA (a \"Duopoly Market\"), then Affiliate, at its option, shall have the right to determine which of its Stations in such DMA shall broadcast the Service; it being understood that Affiliate shall have no obligation to broadcast the Service over more than one of its Stations in any particular DMA.   3\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) Any Acquired Station that is transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate shall (subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph concerning Duopoly Markets) continue to transmit the Service and become a \"Station\" hereunder. Any existing agreement between or among Network and any one or more third parties applicable to such Station for the transmission of the Service shall terminate and cease to be effective upon its acquisition by Affiliate. Any Acquired Station in a DMA that is not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate shall likewise become a \"Station\" hereunder upon acquisition and shall commence transmitting the Service within one hundred eighty (180) days after the acquisition is consummated, unless, as provided in 3(a) above, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service. If condition (A) or (B) applies, the Acquired Station shall have no obligations hereunder, and Network shall have the right to license the transmission of the Service to another Broadcast Television station in such DMA, including on an exclusive basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if condition (A) applies, unless the existing affiliate is a Charter Affiliate, Network shall give Affiliate at least six (6) months' prior written notice of the impending expiration of an existing affiliate's affiliation agreement and, upon such notice, Affiliate shall have the option to add the pertinent Acquired Station as a \"Station\" hereunder as of the date of expiration of the existing affiliate's affiliation agreement, provided that Affiliate exercises such right in writing at least four (4) months prior to the expiration of the existing affiliate's affiliation agreement.   (c) Except as expressly provided in Section 3(a), Affiliate shall not have the right (i) to subdistribute or otherwise sublicense the Service, or (ii) to transmit or otherwise distribute the Service by any technology (other than Broadcast Television), or on an interactive, time- delayed, \"video-on-demand\" or similar basis. For purposes hereof, \"video-on-demand\" means the transmission of a television signal by means of a point-to-point distribution system containing audiovisual programming chosen by a viewer for reception on a viewer's television receiver, where the scheduling of the exhibition of the programming is not predetermined by the distributor, but rather is at the viewer's discretion.\n\n(d) Except as expressly provided in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) and this Section 3(d), Network shall not have the right to distribute or otherwise license the Service for reception in a Station's DMA, including distributing the Service directly through an MVPD in a Station's DMA, other than through this license to Affiliate. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Network shall not distribute or authorize third parties to distribute the Service to subscribers by any technology (other than Broadcast Television and transmission by an MVPD), on an interactive, time-delayed (other than multiple time-zone feeds of the Service), \"video-on-demand\" or similar basis, as an audio-only service (e.g., radio) or over the Internet. For purposes of clarification, a promotional or marketing \"stunt\" simulcasting a live or special event, or brief excerpts of the Service made available on a non-subscription basis for promotional purposes shall not be prohibited by this Section 3(d) or any other provision herein.\n\n4\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) Network hereby grants Affiliate during the Term a royalty-free, fully paid up, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Marks (as defined in Section 8(e)) in any advertising and promotional materials undertaken in connection with Affiliate's transmission of the Service, provided that such use complies with the terms and conditions of Section 8(e).   (f) Upon execution of this Agreement, Affiliate shall promptly complete and deliver to Network a notice of launch (in the form attached hereto in Exhibit B) for each Station (\"Launch Notice\") and subsequently launch the Service on each Station listed on Exhibit A (subject to the provisions of 3(a) above concerning Duopoly Markets) no later than the Launch Date set forth opposite each Station on Exhibit A (for each Station, the \"Launch Date\"). In addition, Affiliate shall promptly complete a Launch Notice for any Acquired Station that is subsequently added to this Agreement.   (g) Each Station, by the terms of this contract, shall be entitled to invoke the protection against duplication of Service programming imported under the compulsory copyright license as provided in Sections 76.101 and 76.123 of the FCC Rules.    (h) Each Station transmitting the Service shall have the right to broadcast the Service on its Primary Feed, in addition to its broadcasts under Section 3(a). Such broadcasts shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Sections 4(e) and 8(c).   4.CONTENT OF THE SERVICE:   (a) Content. Throughout the Term, the Service shall be a professionally produced, advertiser-supported television service with programming consisting of music videos, occasional programs discussing, reviewing and/or relating to music and concerts, related interstitial programming, promotional announcements and commercial announcements in the amounts specified herein, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily targeted to reach adults ages 25-54. Subject to the preceding sentence and other provisions of this Agreement, the selection, scheduling, renewal, substitution and withdrawal of any content on the Service shall at all times remain within Network's sole discretion and control.   (b) Local Programming. Affiliate, at its own cost, shall be provided with thirty (30) minutes per week on the Service, on the same day and at the same time each week, as determined by Network in consultation with Affiliate, for the insertion of programming by Affiliate that is complementary to the Service (\"Local Programming\"), at Affiliate's option. Service programming will be provided during this thirty (30) -minute period for Stations that do not insert Local Programming. It is anticipated that, at a future date to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, Affiliate shall have the right to expand such Local Programming to one (1) hour per week. Affiliate shall be solely responsible for the insertion on a timely basis of the Local Programming into the signal of the Service at the Stations transmitting the Service. Affiliate shall retain all revenue derived from sponsorship of the Local Programming. Affiliate shall apply the same broadcast standards to the Local Programming that it applies to each Station's broadcasts over the Primary Feed. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Local Programming shall not consist of or contain infomercials, home shopping or direct on air sales programming that are not directly related to music and concerts.\n\n5\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Preemption. Affiliate shall retain the right to elect not to transmit any programming on the Service over the broadcast facilities of a Station if Affiliate reasonably believes that such programming is unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public interest, or in order to substitute a program which, in Affiliate's judgment, is of greater local or national importance. Affiliate agrees to notify Network either before or as soon as reasonably practicable after Affiliate exercises such right.\n\n(d) Children's Programming.   (i) Network will provide as part of the Service the minimum number of hours of \"Core Programming,\" as defined in 47 C.F.R. \u00a773.671(c), as the same may be amended from time to time (\"Core Children's Programming\"), and will comply with related requirements of the definition of \"Core Programming\" in order to enable Affiliate to comply with the \"safe harbor\" established by law or FCC regulation, solely with regard to the Service and as a result of the broadcast by the Stations of the Service on each such Station's free, over-the-air, multicast feed.   (ii) Network represents and warrants that if it supplies to Affiliate any programming produced primarily for children 12 years old or younger, such programming shall comply with the FCC's commercial limits, including 47 C.F.R. \u00a773.670, as the same may be amended from time to time, including limits on the amount of commercial matter and the prohibitions on host-selling, program- length commercials and the display of website addresses.   (iii) At the end of each calendar quarter, Network will provide to Affiliate a copy of the Service's schedule of Core Children's Programming planned for the following calendar quarter, together with a certification indicating the amount of Core Children's Programming made available to Affiliate during the preceding quarter and certifying that any programming produced primarily for children 12 years old or younger, as provided by Network, complied with the FCC's rules. Network will provide copies of program logs or other documentation substantiating the amount of Core Children's Programming or the amount of commercial matter in any Network program or program segment subject to the commercial limits, promptly upon request by Affiliate.\n\n(e) Advertising. Except for the Local Advertising and advertising broadcast in Local Programming, Network shall have the exclusive right and authority to sell all of the advertising on the Service and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. A Station will not be obligated to broadcast advertising that does not comply with the Station's generally applicable broadcast standards. Network and Affiliate will cooperate in a good-faith effort to ensure that all Network advertising meets Stations' broadcast standards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Network will not accept political or controversial-issue advertising, or advertising promoting distilled spirits or gambling, without Affiliate's prior written approval.   (f) Program Service Information. Network must provide to a reputable program information services entity a program schedule for the Service.   6\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Closed Captioning; Program Ratings. Network shall provide full-time closed captioning for the Service in all programming and at all times for which captioning is required by applicable law as applied to the Service. Network also shall display and encode program ratings for the Service using the industry-standard \"V-chip\" ratings system.   5.DELIVERY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SERVICE:\n\n(a) During the Term, Network, at its expense, shall deliver a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week signal of the Service by transmitting it via AMC-3 or another domestic satellite commonly used for transmission of television programming to Broadcast Television stations. The signal of the Service, including any program-related data and enhancements, shall be contained in no more than a 5.0 megabits-per-second (\"mbps\") stream of data and shall consist of a resolution of no less than 480 x 720i. Network's failure, for reasons other than force majeure, to deliver a signal meeting the requirements of this Section 5(a) for more than twelve (12) hours in any consecutive thirty (30) day period without the written consent of Affiliate shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, not subject to the cure provisions of Section 10(d); provided, however that Affiliate shall provide Network with notice of each event in which Network fails to deliver a signal meeting the requirements of this Section 5(a) as soon as reasonably practicable.   (b) Exhibit C sets forth the specific equipment necessary for each Station to receive the signal of the Service (the \"Receiving Equipment\"). At Affiliate's option, Network shall furnish and install, at its expense, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, the Receiving Equipment to each Station that transmits the Service, provided that the Receiving Equipment for all of the Stations initially listed on Exhibit A shall not exceed, in the aggregate, one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) (the \"Equipment Reimbursement Cap\"). At Affiliate's option, Network also shall furnish and install, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving Equipment for any Acquired Station not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate, at a cost not to exceed three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500.00). Affiliate, at its expense, shall furnish all other equipment and facilities necessary for the receipt of the satellite transmission of the signal of the Service and the delivery of such signal to TV Households in each Station's DMA. In addition, each Station shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for installing, maintaining or repairing the Receiving Equipment during the Term. Affiliate shall cause each of the Stations to maintain and repair the Receiving Equipment in good working condition, at its sole cost, as necessary and appropriate to maintain the ability of the Receiving Equipment to receive the signal of the Service from its initial satellite and transponder without interruption during the Term. If Network changes the satellite, transponder or encryption method used to transmit the Service and if the Receiving Equipment or other existing equipment will not be suitable for receiving the Service after the changes are implemented, with respect to such Station(s), Network agrees to furnish and install at its expense, or reimburse Affiliate for its reasonable cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving Equipment suitable for receiving the Service after the changes are implemented, without regard to the Equipment Reimbursement Cap; provided, however, that with respect to new equipment made necessary by a satellite, transponder or encryption method change, which equipment may be used to receive the signals of other television services carried by such Station, Network shall be obligated to reimburse Affiliate only for Network's pro-rata share of the cost of such equipment (based on the total number of television services being received by such affected System and utilizing such new equipment within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such change).\n\n7\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Each Station transmitting the Service shall transmit a good-quality video and audio signal of the Service, but in no event shall such Station be required to deliver a signal of a technical quality higher than the technical quality of the video and audio signal of the Service as delivered by Network hereunder.   (d) Each Station agrees to transmit the Service on a full-time basis 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except in cases of force majeure, emergency broadcasts, when a Station's Primary Feed is not being transmitted, as provided in 4(c) above, or when a Station must stop broadcasting for maintenance or repairs. Each Station will provide Network with up to 5.0 mbps, but, at all times, not less than 2.0 mbps, for this purpose, except as required in infrequent and exceptional circumstances resulting from a Station's carriage of the primary television network with which such Station is affiliated with regard to its Primary Feed (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox). Except for a Station's Local Advertising Time and Local Programming, station identification messages, and as except provided in 4(c) and 4(e) above, each Station shall transmit the Service without alteration, editing or delay.   (e)  Network agrees to transmit SCTE 35-compliant DPI commands within the Service that will trigger insertion of Local Advertising and rejoin commands to signal the return to Network programming. Network also will deliver a separate set of SCTE 35-compliant commands to trigger local insertion and removal of station identification messages on the hour, and station logos before and after commercial breaks. To ensure clean switching, Network will ensure that switch commands occur coincident with transmission of an \"I\"-frame from the network MPEG 2 encoder.   (f) Each Station that transmits the Service may superimpose over the programming on the Service a transparent station identification logo/\"bug\" that does not materially interfere with the Service or any graphics or other data therein.   (g) Affiliate and each Station shall take the same security measures to prevent the unauthorized or otherwise unlawful copying or taping of the Service (or any portion thereof) by others as it takes to protect the Primary Feed transmitted by such Station. Network acknowledges that Affiliate and the Stations do not, as of the Effective Date, take any such security measures.   6.NO FEES; REVENUE SHARE:\n\n(a) Neither Affiliate nor any Station shall pay any fees to Network for any rights granted under this Agreement.   (b) In consideration of the terms and conditions set forth herein, Network shall pay Affiliate (i) the Affiliate Advertising Share, and (ii) the Affiliate Transactional Share, each as provided in Exhibit D.   7.REPORTS; AUDITS:   (a) Affiliate shall promptly notify Network in writing of any MVPD that has agreed to retransmit the Service. Network and Affiliate thereafter shall cooperate in an effort to secure the MVPD's agreement to provide to Network and Affiliate, within thirty (30) days following each calendar quarter during the Term, a certified report stating the number of households that receive the Service from such MVPD (\"Digital Cable Subscriber Households\") in the DMA of a Station on average over such quarter (\"Report\"). If an MVPD fails to submit a Report, Network and Affiliate shall estimate the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households receiving the Service pursuant to paragraph I.1. of Exhibit D.\n\n8\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar quarter the following information on a Station-by-Station basis: (i) Network's Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network's Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD in each DMA served by a Station, as calculated herein, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, and this obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until Affiliate receives such statement.   (c) Affiliate shall submit to Network, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter, a report on behalf of each Station with respect to the Promotional Spots aired by each Station during such calendar quarter, setting forth the date and time each such Promotional Spot aired on the Primary Feed.   (d) Audit.   (i) During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Network shall maintain accurate and complete books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices that shall contain sufficient information to enable an auditor to verify, for the period under audit, Network's Advertising Revenue, Network's Transactional Revenue, the Affiliate Advertising Share, the Affiliate Transactional Share and the accuracy of the amounts paid by Network to Affiliate hereunder, including under Exhibit D (collectively, the \"Revenue Share Records\"). Upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice and not more than once in any calendar year, Affiliate shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, during the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, to examine during normal business hours the books and records of Network for up to the prior calendar year and the then-current calendar year solely to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the Revenue Share Records.   (ii) Any audit conducted pursuant to this Section 7(d) shall be conducted by Affiliate's corporate audit staff or an independent auditing firm designated by Affiliate (in each case, an \"Auditor\"). Any such audit shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7(d) and the confidentiality provisions of Section 12, and the Auditor shall execute, in advance, a confidentiality agreement that obligates it to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of this Agreement and the information acquired during the course of the audit. Any officer, employee, consultant or agent of Affiliate that has access to an audit report (who shall be limited to those who are members of Affiliate's corporate audit staff and have a specific need to know the contents thereof) shall also execute a confidentiality agreement consistent with the prior sentence.   9\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (iii) Network and Affiliate shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute arising from an audit conducted pursuant to this Section 7(d). Any litigation by Affiliate with respect to amounts owing by Network in respect of an audit must be brought within one (1) year after the Auditor completes its on-site review at Network's offices, or Affiliate will be deemed to have waived its right, whether known or unknown, to collect any shortfalls from Network for the period(s) audited; provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to intentional misconduct by Network or its agents or employees.   8.PROMOTION; AFFILIATE ADVERTISING:   (a) Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (\"Promotional Spots\") on the Station's Primary Feed, including the Station's analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station. Affiliate will submit program listings for the Service to local print and on-screen guides. Additionally, Affiliate will provide a link to Network's website (i.e., URL www.thetubetv.com or any replacement or supplemental URL) on the websites of each of the Stations.\n\n(b) Network shall produce and deliver the Promotional Spots to each Station at least two (2) weeks prior to the first air date, and on a regular basis thereafter, in a format mutually agreed with Affiliate and in a broadcast-ready state. Affiliate or a Station also may prepare its own Promotional Spots and other promotional materials, which, if using any programming from the Service, must be approved in advance by Network, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Network and Affiliate agree to consult on a regular basis during the Term concerning the content of the Promotional Spots, promotional materials and on Network and Affiliate promotional strategies, and Affiliate shall cease airing particular Promotional Spots or using particular promotional materials upon the reasonable objection of Network to such Promotional Spots or the use of such promotional materials.   (c) Network shall provide to each Station that transmits the Service for local advertising sales, public service announcements, newsbreaks, station-produced vignettes or promotion one (1) minute of commercial announcement time per hour (\"Local Advertising\"), normally at the same approximate time each hour of the broadcast day. Affiliate shall have the right to retain for itself all the proceeds derived from the sale of Local Advertising. Affiliate agrees not to sell commercial time to or for the benefit of direct competitors of the Service (e.g., music video networks carried by MVPDs such as MTV, VH1 and Fuse). All Local Advertising shall comply with the pertinent Station's generally applicable broadcast standards and Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all Local Advertising and all liabilities associated therewith, including insertion, trafficking, billing and collection activities relating to the Local Advertising and for the content of the material inserted into the Local Advertising.   (d) Network, from time to time, may undertake marketing tests and surveys, rating polls and other research in connection with the Service. With respect to any tests, surveys or research that apply to any Station or DMA for which Network seeks Affiliate's cooperation, Network shall notify Affiliate of the nature and scope of each such project and Affiliate, to the extent permitted by applicable law and agreements by which Affiliate or a Station is bound, shall cooperate in such research by rendering such assistance as Network may reasonably request and which Affiliate can reasonably provide without incurring any additional expense. Network shall, promptly following receipt, provide the full results of any such research to Affiliate, on a confidential basis, unless Network is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality agreement or applicable law.\n\n10\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) Affiliate acknowledges that the name and mark \"The TUBE\" (and the names of certain programs that appear in the Service and any subsequently selected names or marks for the Service and accompanying websites) (collectively, the \"Marks\") are the exclusive property of Network and its suppliers and that Affiliate has not and will not acquire any ownership thereof by reason of this Agreement. Provided they do not infringe the marks of Affiliate or an affiliate of Affiliate, Affiliate shall not directly or indirectly question, attack, contest or in any other manner impugn the validity of the Marks or Network's rights in and to the Marks and shall reasonably cooperate with Network's quality control, monitoring and inspection of the use of the Marks. Any and all goodwill arising from Affiliate's use of the Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of Network. Affiliate shall submit to Network representative samples of Affiliate's promotional materials mentioning or using the Marks (other than materials provided by Network to Affiliate, if any) and shall cease using the Marks in a particular manner upon the reasonable objection of Network to the use of the Marks in such manner. Uses of the Marks in routine promotional materials, such as program guides and program listings, shall be deemed approved unless Network specifically notifies Affiliate to the contrary. Network shall acquire no rights in any of Affiliate's marks by virtue of this Agreement.   9.WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES:\n\n(a) Network and Affiliate each represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state under which it is organized; (ii) it has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform fully its obligations hereunder; (iii) it is under no contractual or other legal obligation that shall in any way interfere with its full, prompt and complete performance hereunder; (iv) the individual executing this Agreement on its behalf has the authority to do so; and (v) the obligations created by this Agreement, insofar as they purport to be binding on it, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms.

Affiliate agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of any proposed assignee or transferee that, upon consummation of the assignment or transfer of control of the FCC license for any Station, such assignee or transferee shall negotiate in good faith with Network for continued rights to broadcast the Service over the affected Station. It will not be a breach of this Agreement, and Affiliate will not be required to accept a lower price or different terms in a proposed acquisition, if the proposed assignee or transferee does not accept this condition. Affiliate agrees to give Network timely notice of the filing of an assignment or transfer of control application with the FCC.   (b) Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. This Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes and abrogates all contemporaneous and prior understandings of the parties, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be modified except in a writing executed by both parties hereto. No waiver of any breach of any provision hereof shall be or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. The failure of Affiliate or Network to enforce or seek enforcement of the terms of this Agreement following any breach shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same or any other terms of this Agreement. All remedies, whether at law, in equity or pursuant to this Agreement shall be cumulative.   (c) Governing Law. The obligations of Affiliate and Network under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and this Agreement and all matters or issues collateral thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to be entirely performed therein.   (d) Relationship. Neither party shall be, or hold itself out as, the agent of the other or as joint venturers under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create, and the parties do not intend to create, any partnership, association, joint venture, fiduciary or agency relationship between Affiliate and Network, and neither party is authorized to or shall act toward third parties or the public in any manner which would indicate any such relationship with the other.   (e) Force Majeure. Neither Affiliate nor Network shall have any rights against the other party hereto for the non-operation of facilities or the non-furnishing of the Service if such non-operation or non-furnishing is due to an act of God; inevitable accident; fire; weather; lockout; strike or other labor dispute; riot or civil commotion; action or inaction of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal, state or local); failure of performance by a common or private carrier; material failure or unavailability in whole or in part of technical facilities, software or equipment which are material to the transmission of the Service; or other cause beyond either party's reasonable control (financial inability is excepted). A party will have the right to terminate this Agreement as to the affected Station(s), by notice to the other, if the other party's inability to perform continues for thirty (30) days or more; provided, that Network may not terminate this Agreement due to a Station's failure to launch the Service for reasons specified solely in this Section 13(e) unless such Station is unable to launch the Service for ninety (90) days or more beyond the applicable Launch Date.   15\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) No Inference Against Author. Network and Affiliate each acknowledge that this Agreement was fully negotiated by the parties and, therefore, no provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted against any party because such party or its legal representative drafted such provision.   (g) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto (including the Stations) and their permitted assigns, and no third party shall be a beneficiary of, or have any rights by virtue of, this Agreement.   (h) Headings. The titles, headings of the sections and defined terms in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the interpretation of this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to \"Section\" or an \"Exhibit\" shall, unless the context expressly requires otherwise, be a reference to \"Section\" in, or an \"Exhibit\" to, this Agreement. Forms of the word \"include\" mean \"including without limitation;\" and references to \"hereunder,\" \"herein,\" \"hereof,\" and the like, refer to this Agreement.   (i) Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that each and every representation, warranty, covenant, undertaking and agreement made in this Agreement was not made or intended to be made as a personal representation, undertaking, warranty, covenant, or agreement on the part of any individual, and any recourse, whether in common law, in equity, by statute or otherwise, against any individual is hereby forever waived and released.   (j) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OF REVENUES, OR DAMAGES TO OR LOSS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY) IN ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH A DEFAULT UNDER OR A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.   (k) Taxes. Network shall not be liable for, and Affiliate shall pay and hold harmless Network from, any federal, state or local taxes, surcharges, levies or any other charges which are based upon revenues derived by operations of Affiliate or each Station. Neither Affiliate nor Station shall be liable for, and Network shall pay and hold Affiliate and each Station harmless from, any federal, state or local taxes, surcharges, levies or any other charges which are based upon revenues derived by operations of Network.   16\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(l) Right of First Refusal. In the event Network decides to offer any new television programming channels (the \"New Channels\"), then Affiliate shall have ninety (90) calendar days from Affiliate's receipt of Network's comprehensive business plan for such New Channels to determine whether Affiliate desires to enter into an agreement with respect to the New Channels. At the expiration of the ninety (90)-day period, Affiliate's right of first refusal shall expire. If, during said ninety (90)-day period, Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its desire to add the New Channels to this Agreement, then both parties shall work diligently together and in good faith to enter into an agreement within ninety (90) days of such notice to include the terms and conditions pursuant to which the New Channels may be distributed by Affiliate. If, having used good faith diligent efforts, Affiliate and Network have failed to enter into such an agreement within such ninety (90)-day period, then neither party shall have an obligation to continue such negotiations or enter into an agreement with respect to the New Channels.   (m) Matter Broadcast. Federal law and FCC regulations require Network to disclose to Affiliate, and the Stations to disclose to their audiences, the identity of any person or entity that has given anything of value to Network or anyone associated with the Service in exchange for the inclusion of a product, service, trademark, brand name, or other program material in the Service. Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, in writing, the existence, source and nature of any payments or other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service. Such disclosure shall be made prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, proper disclosure in the content of the Service will satisfy Network's disclosure obligations to Affiliate under this Section 13(m), provided Network agrees to provide full details to Affiliate immediately upon request.   (n) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will have the full force and effect of a fully- executed original. This Agreement may be executed by each or either party by delivering signed signature pages thereof to the other party by facsimile. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall also deliver to the other party an original executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure to do so does not affect the validity, enforceability or binding effect of this Agreement.

Dated as of March 6, 2006   REVENUE SHARE    Commencing on the Affiliate Launch Date and thereafter throughout the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the following amounts:\n\nI.Affiliate Advertising Share.   1.Determining Affiliate Advertising Share. Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Advertising Share. For purposes hereof, the \"Affiliate Advertising Share\" shall be determined by multiplying fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Advertising Revenue for such calendar quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in the DMA(s) of the Station(s) transmitting the Service pursuant to this Agreement, and the denominator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in all of the DMAs in which Network has a broadcast television station affiliate that is transmitting the Service. If a Station commences transmitting the Service on other than the first day of a calendar quarter, then the Affiliate Advertising Share for such quarter shall be further prorated based on the number of days in such quarter that such Station transmitted the Service. For purposes of this Exhibit D, The number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be determined by the certified report supplied by each MVPD distributing the service, described in Section 7(a) of the body of this Agreement. In the event that such report is not received by Network with respect to each and every MVPD that carries the Service, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be determined as follows:    a.In the event that the total number of linear digital video subscribers served by an MVPD that distributes the Service is not broken out by DMAs in such MVPD's reported data, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV Households receiving linear video services from such MVPD's systems that carry the Service in the pertinent DMA as set forth in a Nielsen report such as FOCUS multiplied by (y) the National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage most recently reported by such MVPD. The \"National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage\" shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the total number of subscribers to linear digital video services as most recently publicly reported by such MVPD, divided by (ii) the total number of TV Households receiving linear video services from such MVPD as most recently publicly reported by such MVPD.\n\n22\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n   b. In the event that a particular MVPD does not report its total number of subscribers to linear digital video services and total number of TV Households receiving linear video services, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV Households receiving linear video services served by such MVPD's systems that carry the Service as set forth in a Nielsen report such as FOCUS multiplied by (y) a national digital cable penetration estimate from Kagan Research, LLC.    c. In the event that a more accurate independent publicly available source for determining the number of television households that receive the Service through a subscription cable service hereafter becomes available, the parties may mutually agree to use such source in lieu of the foregoing.   2.Payment. The Affiliate Advertising Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter, the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.    II.Affiliate Transactional Share.   1.Determining Affiliate Transactional Share. Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Transactional Share. For purposes hereof, the \"Affiliate Transactional Share\" means fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Transactional Revenue for the pertinent calendar quarter.   2.Payment. The Affiliate Transactional Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter, the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.   23\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT E   To Affiliation Agreement By and Between   Tribune Broadcasting Company and   The TUBE Music Network, Inc.   Dated as of March 6, 2006   ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS   Music Rights and Copyright Indemnification   Without limiting Network's indemnification obligations as set forth in the body of this Agreement:   Network agrees to indemnify the Affiliate Indemnitees against any and all Costs arising out of any (i) third-party claims that Network's music performance rights licenses with ASCAP, BMI and SESAC (or directly with the applicable composer(s) and publisher(s)) do not cover music performances through to the viewers of the Service; and (ii) written agreement between Affiliate and an MVPD for the retransmission of the Service (together with the Primary Feed as provided in Section 3(a) of the body of the Agreement) solely within the Station's DMA, or where the Station's signal is deemed \"significantly viewed\" pursuant to FCC rules, pursuant to which Affiliate is obligated to indemnify such MVPD against any Incremental Copyright Cost (as defined below) resulting directly from the retransmission of the Service by such MVPD in the Station's DMA. For purposes hereof, \"Incremental Copyright Cost\" shall mean the difference, if any, between (A) the copyright royalties that would be payable by the MVPD in the Station's DMA without carriage of the Service, and (B) the copyright royalties that would be payable by such MVPD in such DMA with the carriage of the Service. Network hereby authorizes Affiliate to enter into such an agreement if, in Affiliate's reasonable and good faith judgment, such an agreement is necessary to obtain an MVPD's consent to carry the Service. For purposes of clarification, ASCAP, BMI and SESAC are and shall be considered \"third parties.\" Network represents and warrants that it has and throughout the Term will have a valid through- to-the-viewer music performance rights license with ASCAP and BMI (and any other society that may license such rights for music contained in the Service) (or directly with the applicable composer(s) and publisher(s)) covering all of the music contained in the Service. Network has commenced negotiations for a through-to-the-viewer music performance rights license with SESAC and expects to attain such license within a reasonable period of time.\n\n24\n\n\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006", "clauses": [{"start": 67043, "end": 67197, "text": "For purposes hereof, the \"Affiliate Transactional Share\" means fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Transactional Revenue for the pertinent calendar quarter.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 63059, "end": 63243, "text": "Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Advertising Share.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 63245, "end": 63799, "text": "For purposes hereof, the \"Affiliate Advertising Share\" shall be determined by multiplying fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Advertising Revenue for such calendar quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in the DMA(s) of the Station(s) transmitting the Service pursuant to this Agreement, and the denominator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in all of the DMAs in which Network has a broadcast television station affiliate that is transmitting the Service.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 66855, "end": 67041, "text": "Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Transactional Share.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 26908, "end": 27109, "text": "In consideration of the terms and conditions set forth herein, Network shall pay Affiliate (i) the Affiliate Advertising Share, and (ii) the Affiliate Transactional Share, each as provided in Exhibit D.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 19189, "end": 19515, "text": "Except for the Local Advertising and advertising broadcast in Local Programming, Network shall have the exclusive right and authority to sell all of the advertising on the Service and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.", "fine_label": "revenue/profit sharing", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 25006, "end": 25353, "text": "Each Station will provide Network with up to 5.0 mbps, but, at all times, not less than 2.0 mbps, for this purpose, except as required in infrequent and exceptional circumstances resulting from a Station's carriage of the primary television network with which such Station is affiliated with regard to its Primary Feed (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox)", "fine_label": "minimum commitment", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 31581, "end": 32094, "text": "Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (\"Promotional Spots\") on the Station's Primary Feed, including the Station's analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station.", "fine_label": "minimum commitment", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 25006, "end": 25059, "text": "Each Station will provide Network with up to 5.0 mbps,", "fine_label": "volume restriction", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 25104, "end": 25354, "text": "for this purpose, except as required in infrequent and exceptional circumstances resulting from a Station's carriage of the primary television network with which such Station is affiliated with regard to its Primary Feed (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox).", "fine_label": "volume restriction", "broad_label": "Financial & Commercial Terms Agent"}, {"start": 21100, "end": 21648, "text": "Network's failure, for reasons other than force majeure, to deliver a signal meeting the requirements of this Section 5(a) for more than twelve (12) hours in any consecutive thirty (30) day period without the written consent of Affiliate shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, not subject to the cure provisions of Section 10(d);
