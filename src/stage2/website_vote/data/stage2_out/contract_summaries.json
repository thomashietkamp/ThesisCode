It addresses the dissolution of Thrivent Life Insurance Company and the transfer of all its assets and liabilities, including this contract, to Thrivent Financial for Lutherans (TFFL). TFFL now assumes all obligations under the contract.\n\nThe main purpose is to update the contract to reflect the corporate restructuring, amending references to the former entity (\"Thrivent Life Insurance Company\") to \"Thrivent Financial for Lutherans\" throughout the document.  Key changes include updating the address and contact information, clarifying the definition of \"We/Us/Our\" to refer to TFFL, and amending the \"Entire Contract\" section to include the Society's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\n\nTFFL's main obligation is to fulfill all previous obligations under the original contract.  The insured's obligations remain largely unchanged, though a maintenance of solvency provision outlines potential extra payments in case of TFFL's impaired solvency.  Dividend provisions are clarified, specifying payment methods.  The contract also addresses membership rights (separate from contract ownership) and assignment of ownership (subject to bylaws).  No specific duration or termination clause is detailed in this summary, but the underlying contract's terms remain in effect, subject to the amendments.  Financial arrangements are governed by the original contract, with the addition of the solvency provision.",

The agreement outlines a revenue-sharing partnership where Kubient provides advertising and revenue consultation services to AP for its digital properties (websites, apps, etc.).\n\nKubient's key obligations include providing advertising consultation and introducing AP to third-party advertisers.  AP's key obligations include a non-circumvention clause preventing AP from working with third-parties introduced by Kubient for one year post-termination without Kubient's consent and compensation, and a non-solicitation clause preventing AP from hiring Kubient's employees for one year post-termination.\n\nRevenue sharing is detailed in Schedule 1, varying by advertising type (programmatic, video, direct deals, etc.) and exceeding or falling below specified monthly revenue thresholds.  Below threshold, Kubient receives a guaranteed draw (expiring September 1, 2020); above threshold, revenue is split 50/50.  Reconciliation and payment are net 30 days after the end of each month.  Specific revenue exclusions exist for certain pre-existing AP relationships.\n\nThe agreement lacks explicit duration or termination clauses beyond the implied continuation from the Master Services Agreement.  Schedule 1 supersedes conflicting terms in Exhibit A of the Master Services Agreement regarding fees and payment terms.",

    "summary": "This Endorsement Agreement, dated April 4, 2003, amends a prior Split Dollar Agreement between Movado Group, Inc. (\"Company\") and the Grinberg Family Trust (\"Trust\").  The agreement addresses concerns regarding Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance related to loans to executive officers.  The Trust transfers ownership of a New York Life Insurance Company policy (Policy No. 45660373) to the Company as partial repayment of a $5,186,860 loan (Demand Note), with the Company receiving the policy's cash surrender value ($4,595,591).\n\nThe Company becomes the policy owner, responsible for future premiums, but requires Trust consent for policy loans, withdrawals, or surrender. Upon the death of the insured(s), the death benefit is split: the Company receives its aggregate premiums paid less the outstanding Demand Note balance; the Trust receives any excess.  The Company's failure to pay premiums or unauthorized policy actions constitutes a \"Company Default,\" allowing the Trust to reclaim the policy.\n\nThe agreement specifies notice procedures, designates New York law as governing (except where preempted by ERISA), and includes detailed claims procedures if subject to ERISA.  The agreement terminates upon the Trust's full repayment of the remaining Demand Note balance ($591,269) plus aggregate premiums paid, at which point the Company transfers the policy back to the Trust.  The agreement explicitly states it is not a contract of employment.",

The Guarantors' primary obligation is to ensure payment of all monies owed by the Master Franchisee to the Franchisor and to guarantee full performance of all Master Franchisee obligations under the Master Franchise Agreement.  This guarantee covers all losses, damages, costs, and expenses incurred by the Franchisor due to the Master Franchisee's defaults.  Crucially, the Franchisor is not required to pursue remedies against the Master Franchisee before pursuing the Guarantors.  The Franchisor can modify or release the Master Franchisee's obligations without notifying the Guarantors, and the Guarantors waive notice of such actions. The Guarantors' obligations remain in effect regardless of the Master Franchisee's bankruptcy, insolvency, or termination of the Master Franchise Agreement.  The agreement's governing law is determined by the Franchisor's principal place of business, with exceptions for enforceability based on the Master Franchisee's business location.  Venue for any action is specified as the Franchisor's principal place of business.  No specific duration or termination clause is explicitly stated beyond the implicit termination tied to the underlying Master Franchise Agreement.  Financial arrangements are implicitly tied to the underlying Master Franchise Agreement's terms.",

The amendment extends the agreement's term to July 20, 2006 (originally September 30, 2003).\n\nThe core purpose is management and maintenance of a power transmission line.  ToyoWest Management Inc. (Manager) is obligated to manage and maintain the line.  A crucial addition is Section 7.4, granting the Manager the right to curtail power from specific partners (\"LIFO Partners\") under defined circumstances (transmission line capacity issues or excessive line losses).  Curtailment priority can be established by the LIFO Partners; otherwise, the Manager decides.  The LIFO Partners bear the costs of resolving curtailment issues.\n\nThe agreement incorporates Article 10 of the original agreement (unspecified).  No financial arrangements are detailed in this amendment, but it references existing agreements impacting financial aspects.  Termination is not explicitly addressed in this amendment but is presumably governed by the original agreement's terms, extended to July 20, 2006.",
